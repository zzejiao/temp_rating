Question 2. What are the Principles for Depression Management? > Q.2.f. What Lifestyle Interventions are Effective? > paragraph id: 66

Regarding diet, many observational studies support the association of an unhealthy diet (high content of refined carbohydrates and saturated fat, and low content of fruits and vegetables, commonly called the Western diet) with increased prevalence and severity of depressive symptoms (Level 3) . In contrast, there are few interventional studies of diet manipulation. There is only 1 RCT (Randomized controlled trial) showing a modest effect of a Mediterranean-type diet in adults with MDD (Major depressive disorder), supporting a third-line recommendation (Level 3) ( Table 2.4 ). With regard to newer interventions such as probiotics, current evidence is equivocal, neither supporting nor refuting beneficial effects. Hence, there is insufficient evidence to recommend probiotics in the treatment of MDD (Major depressive disorder).

Question 2. What are the Principles for Depression Management? > Q.2.f. What Lifestyle Interventions are Effective? > paragraph id: 61

The CANMAT (Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments) 2016 guidelines noted substantial evidence for the efficacy of exercise as a treatment for MDD (Major depressive disorder) (Level 2) . While recognizing heterogeneity in RCT (Randomized controlled trial) methods, recent meta-analyses continue to show that adjunctive exercise is superior to no treatment and treatment as usual conditions in MDD (Major depressive disorder), with medium to large effects (Level 1) . Exercise can also reduce suicidal ideation and has good effects when combined with antidepressants. Meta-analyses show benefits in reducing depressive symptoms with the supervised aerobic activity of moderate to high intensity in adolescents and young adults, with low to moderate intensity exercise in midlife and older women, and with high-intensity interval training in adults. Exercise also provides positive health benefits beyond its effects on depression. Taken together, these findings continue to support the use of supervised exercise (i.e., low to moderate intensity, for 30 to 40 min at a time, 3 to 4 times a week, for a minimum of 9 weeks) as a first-line monotherapy for mild depression and a second-line adjunctive treatment for moderate severity illness (Level 1) (Table 2.4 and Table 3.7).

Question 3. How are Treatments Selected? > Q.3.g. How do DSM-5-TR Specifiers and Symptom Dimensions Influence Medication Selection? > paragraph id: 101

The 2016 CANMAT (Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments) guidelines also identified some symptom dimensions not included in DSM-5-TR that may have treatment specificity ( Table 3.6 ). Cognitive symptoms (problems with concentration, memory, and executive functioning) are common in MDD (Major depressive disorder) and medications such as vortioxetine, bupropion, and SNRIs may have superior efficacy for cognitive dysfunction compared to SSRIs (Level 2) . Recent meta-analyses support these findings. Duloxetine and other SNRIs show more benefits for comorbid pain conditions compared to SSRIs. Energy, fatigue, and motivation symptoms may preferentially respond to SNRIs compared to SSRIs (Level 2) .

Question 7. What Should be Done When a Patient is not Better? > Q.7.g. What are the Risks and Benefits of Specific Adjunctive Medications? > Serotonin-Dopamine Activity Modulators (Low-Dose Atypical Antipsychotics) > paragraph id: 198

Adjunctive treatment with serotonin-dopamine activity modulators (also known as atypical antipsychotic agents) has the most consistent evidence for efficacy in DTD (Difficult-to-treat depression) ( Table 7.2 ). Typically, lower doses of these medications are used for adjunctive treatment in MDD (Major depressive disorder) compared to other conditions such as bipolar disorder or schizophrenia. Most of the listed medications have evidence for efficacy, with network meta-analyses showing that they are more efficacious than placebo (Level 1) . Aripiprazole and brexpiprazole are listed as first-line agents because of their efficacy and tolerability profile. Cariprazine is recommended as the second-line because there are fewer studies compared to the other agents. Ziprasidone is included as a third-line recommendation because of mixed efficacy results in RCTs and network meta-analyses.

Question 3. How are Treatments Selected? > Q.3.a. How is the Initial Treatment Selected? > paragraph id: 74

In severe cases of MDE (Major depressive episode) with high safety risk and without psychotic features, CANMAT (Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments) recommends the combination of antidepressant medication and psychotherapy, either started at the same time or in a staggered fashion as planned sequential treatment (Level 2) (see Q.3.b). For severe MDE (Major depressive episode) with psychotic symptoms, the combination of an antidepressant and an atypical antipsychotic (serotonin-dopamine activity modulator) is recommended; structured psychotherapy should not be considered until psychotic symptoms subside (Level 1) . In the most severe MDEs and/or in life-threatening situations (e.g., severe suicide risk and physical deterioration), electroconvulsive therapy (ECT (Electroconvulsive therapy)) should be considered as the first-choice option (Level 3) .

Question 7. What Should be Done When a Patient is not Better? > Q.7.f. How is an Adjunctive Medication Selected? > paragraph id: 196

Selecting an adjunctive medication involves consideration of efficacy and tolerability, for both the adjunctive agent ( Table 7.2 ) and the continued antidepressant. The various adjunctive agents have very different side effect profiles and potential drug–drug interactions should also be considered. If pharmacogenetic test results are available, these may help in treatment selection, especially in DTD (Difficult-to-treat depression) (Level 3) . An often-used approach is to select an adjunctive medication which can address specific residual symptoms and/or side effects experienced by the patient (e.g., using a sedating medication when insomnia is present); there is, however, little evidence available to support this strategy. An important tip when considering adjunctive treatments is to minimize polypharmacy as much as possible by reassessing concurrent medications and discontinuing those with unclear benefits.

Methylphenidate and other stimulants have been studied for the treatment of MDD (Major depressive disorder) with mixed results. Outcomes differ widely across stimulants when used as monotherapy or adjunctive treatment and a network meta-analysis found mixed efficacy results. Side effects of stimulants include anxiety, irritability, jitteriness and tremors, headaches, insomnia, and appetite/weight loss. Additionally, tolerance may develop so that early improvements (especially in domains of energy, motivation, and cognition) may quickly wane over time. Consequently, CANMAT (Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments) recommends stimulants as third-line adjunctive treatments (Level 2) .

Question 7. What Should be Done When a Patient is not Better? > Q.7.h. What Psychological Treatments are Effective After Poor Response to the Initial Antidepressant? > paragraph id: 211

There are few studies of psychotherapy for patients showing poor response to antidepressants. A Cochrane review of patients with poor response to an initial antidepressant found moderate-quality evidence supporting psychotherapy (primarily from 1 large trial of CBT (Cognitive-behavioural therapy)) added to usual care (including antidepressants) for reducing depressive symptoms and increasing response and remission rates (Level 2) . Hence, CBT (Cognitive-behavioural therapy) is recommended as a second-line adjunctive treatment, with medications, for DTD (Difficult-to-treat depression).

Question 3. How are Treatments Selected? > Q.3.a. How is the Initial Treatment Selected? > paragraph id: 73

For MDE (Major depressive episode) of moderate severity with a low–moderate safety risk, the initial choice is between structured psychotherapy and antidepressant medication, the 2 treatment modalities with the most robust and consistent evidence for safety and efficacy (Level 1) . The choice between the two is less straightforward and depends on context, availability, and patient preference. Structured psychotherapies and first-line antidepressant medications are equally effective in treating MDD (Major depressive disorder) in the short term. Antidepressants may be slightly more efficacious in reducing symptoms of depressed mood, guilt, suicidal thoughts, anxiety, and somatic symptoms during the acute treatment phase, but structured psychotherapy (specifically, CBT (Cognitive-behavioural therapy)), is more efficacious than antidepressants at 6- to 12-month follow-up. The combination of antidepressant medication and psychotherapy should also be considered (Level 2) . Finally, exercise, certain CAM (Complementary and alternative medicine) treatments, and DHIs can also be used as adjunctive treatments to pharmacotherapy and/or psychotherapy, especially when preferred by the patient.

Question 3. How are Treatments Selected? > Q.3.a. How is the Initial Treatment Selected? > paragraph id: 74

In severe cases of MDE (Major depressive episode) with high safety risk and without psychotic features, CANMAT (Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments) recommends the combination of antidepressant medication and psychotherapy, either started at the same time or in a staggered fashion as planned sequential treatment (Level 2) (see Q.3.b). For severe MDE (Major depressive episode) with psychotic symptoms, the combination of an antidepressant and an atypical antipsychotic (serotonin-dopamine activity modulator) is recommended; structured psychotherapy should not be considered until psychotic symptoms subside (Level 1) . In the most severe MDEs and/or in life-threatening situations (e.g., severe suicide risk and physical deterioration), electroconvulsive therapy (ECT (Electroconvulsive therapy)) should be considered as the first-choice option (Level 3) .

Question 3. How are Treatments Selected? > Q.3.m. What Complementary and Alternative Medicine Treatments are Effective? > paragraph id: 119

CAM (Complementary and alternative medicine) treatments are increasingly used to manage depression. Here we provide recommendations for using the CAM (Complementary and alternative medicine) treatments that have the best quality evidence, focusing on new data since the CANMAT (Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments) 2016 guidelines (see Sarris et al., 2022, for practical guidance/dosage information). To date, no CAM (Complementary and alternative medicine) treatment has reached the level of evidence that would make it comparable to a first-line psychotherapy or pharmacotherapy treatment for moderate to severe depression. There is also inconsistency in the therapeutic dose ranges of most CAM (Complementary and alternative medicine) treatments. CANMAT (Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments) therefore recommends the consideration of CAM (Complementary and alternative medicine) treatments alone only for MDE (Major depressive episode) of mild severity (see Q.3.a), whereas CAM (Complementary and alternative medicine) treatments may be used as adjuncts to standard treatments in moderate severity illness.

Question 2. What are the Principles for Depression Management? > Q.2.d. What is the Role of Patient Preference? > paragraph id: 55

Patient preference plays a key role in depression management. SDM (Shared decision-making) helps establish a strong therapeutic alliance which facilitates psychoeducation about critical aspects of the treatment, including achieving symptom remission and promoting long-term mental wellness. Clinicians should ensure that patients are aware of the broad range of treatment options available for MDD (Major depressive disorder), including lifestyle changes and self-management, psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy, neuromodulation, and complementary and alternative medicine (CAM (Complementary and alternative medicine)) treatments. Clinicians also should explain how treatments work and dispel myths and stigma (e.g., related to medications or role of stress). CANMAT (Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments) has created a patient and family guide to depression treatment (CHOICE-D) as a psychoeducational aid, available for free download at www.CANMAT (Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments).org .

Other herbs such as Crocus sativus (saffron), Lavandula (lavender), and Rhodiola (roseroot) have only modest evidence for benefit in MDE (Major depressive episode). A meta-analysis found the efficacy of saffron for reducing depressive symptoms when compared to placebo and as an adjunct to antidepressants. Another meta-analysis on the efficacy of lavender reported a reduction in depressive symptoms compared to control conditions. However, given the modest benefit and the major limitations of the RCTs, saffron, lavender, and roseroot continue to be recommended as third-line treatments in mild illness (Level 3) ( Table 3.7 ).

Conclusions > paragraph id: 237

The 2023 update of the CANMAT (Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments) depression guidelines provides a comprehensive and evidence-informed framework for managing MDD (Major depressive disorder) in adults. Healthcare providers can use the new and updated recommendations to collaboratively guide individuals with MDD (Major depressive disorder) through their care journey from assessment to evidence-based treatments, with the overall aim of optimizing their personal, functional, and quality of life outcomes.

Introduction > paragraph id: 10

The scope of these guidelines is the management of MDD (Major depressive disorder) in adults, with a target audience of community-based psychiatrists and mental health providers. CANMAT (Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments) previously published guidelines for bipolar disorder, in collaboration with the International Society for Bipolar Disorders (ISBD), and clinical guidelines for perinatal mood and anxiety-related disorders are in development; guidelines for other populations such as geriatric and pediatric depression are in planning. As done with previous versions, CANMAT (Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments) will produce briefer summaries of the guidelines for clinicians, such as the CANMAT (Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments) Pocket Guide to Depression. Additionally, the CHOICE-D Patient and Family Guide to Depression Treatment will be revised to reflect the content of the updated guidelines for patient and public knowledge dissemination.

Question 7. What Should be Done When a Patient is not Better? > Q.7.d. When and how Should Antidepressants be Switched? > paragraph id: 191

Early improvement, often defined as a 20% or greater reduction in scores on a symptom rating scale within the first 4 weeks after starting an antidepressant, predicts a later response. Notably, if early improvement is not seen by 4 weeks, there is only a low likelihood of response or remission at 8 to 12 weeks. At that point, the decision should be to either increase the dose or to switch the antidepressant if there are tolerability concerns.

Question 7. What Should be Done When a Patient is not Better? > Q.7.c. How are Strategies Sequenced When There is a Poor Response to an Initial Antidepressant Treatment? > paragraph id: 187

Optimizing the antidepressant dose is an important first step. Higher than minimal therapeutic doses are more effective (to a plateau around the equivalent of 50 mg of fluoxetine) but less well-tolerated (Level 1) . Hence, increasing the dose for nonresponse must be balanced against increasing side effect burden and poorer adherence.

Question 7. What Should be Done When a Patient is not Better? > Q.7.c. How are Strategies Sequenced When There is a Poor Response to an Initial Antidepressant Treatment? > paragraph id: 188

After optimizing the dose, the main medication options involve switching to another antidepressant or adding an adjunctive medication. The evidence for the efficacy of switching antidepressants is inconsistent. Meta-analyses show that switching to another antidepressant is not superior to continuing the same one (Level 2) and there appears to be diminishing response rates for antidepressant monotherapy beyond the first switch.

Question 7. What Should be Done When a Patient is not Better? > Q.7.a. What Contributes to a Poor Response to Treatment? > paragraph id: 180

In real-world populations, approximately half of patients with MDD (Major depressive disorder) achieve response (>50% reduction in symptom severity) after 8 weeks of antidepressant monotherapy, while about a third attain full symptom remission; only a quarter of nonremitters who receive a second pharmacological treatment will reach remission. For first-treatment patients, the remission rates are higher, but almost half will not achieve remission with antidepressants after 6 months of treatment. Hence, inadequate response to treatment is a common clinical challenge.

Question 7. What Should be Done When a Patient is not Better? > Q.7.b. What is the Difference Between Treatment-Resistant Depression and Difficult-to-Treat Depression? > paragraph id: 182

“Treatment-resistant depression (TRD (Treatment-resistant depression))” is a term used to describe a lack of response to initial treatments. There is no universal consensus on a definition for TRD (Treatment-resistant depression), but the one most frequently used is failure to respond to 2 or more antidepressant trials at a therapeutic dose and adequate duration. This definition has been criticized because it neglects psychological and neurostimulation treatments, it assumes that switching antidepressants is the preferred initial strategy and neglects add-on strategies. Furthermore, “failure” is often not defined or defined differently from study to study, and it does not account for partial response or residual symptoms. Additionally, the term “resistant” has a negative connotation which suggests futility and may discourage patients and clinicians from further therapeutic interventions.

Question 7. What Should be Done When a Patient is not Better? > Q.7.a. What Contributes to a Poor Response to Treatment? > paragraph id: 180

In real-world populations, approximately half of patients with MDD (Major depressive disorder) achieve response (>50% reduction in symptom severity) after 8 weeks of antidepressant monotherapy, while about a third attain full symptom remission; only a quarter of nonremitters who receive a second pharmacological treatment will reach remission. For first-treatment patients, the remission rates are higher, but almost half will not achieve remission with antidepressants after 6 months of treatment. Hence, inadequate response to treatment is a common clinical challenge.

Question 7. What Should be Done When a Patient is not Better? > Q.7.d. When and how Should Antidepressants be Switched? > paragraph id: 191

Early improvement, often defined as a 20% or greater reduction in scores on a symptom rating scale within the first 4 weeks after starting an antidepressant, predicts a later response. Notably, if early improvement is not seen by 4 weeks, there is only a low likelihood of response or remission at 8 to 12 weeks. At that point, the decision should be to either increase the dose or to switch the antidepressant if there are tolerability concerns.

Question 3. How are Treatments Selected? > Q.3.g. How do DSM-5-TR Specifiers and Symptom Dimensions Influence Medication Selection? > paragraph id: 101

The 2016 CANMAT (Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments) guidelines also identified some symptom dimensions not included in DSM-5-TR that may have treatment specificity ( Table 3.6 ). Cognitive symptoms (problems with concentration, memory, and executive functioning) are common in MDD (Major depressive disorder) and medications such as vortioxetine, bupropion, and SNRIs may have superior efficacy for cognitive dysfunction compared to SSRIs (Level 2) . Recent meta-analyses support these findings. Duloxetine and other SNRIs show more benefits for comorbid pain conditions compared to SSRIs. Energy, fatigue, and motivation symptoms may preferentially respond to SNRIs compared to SSRIs (Level 2) .

Question 7. What Should be Done When a Patient is not Better? > Q.7.h. What Psychological Treatments are Effective After Poor Response to the Initial Antidepressant? > paragraph id: 211

There are few studies of psychotherapy for patients showing poor response to antidepressants. A Cochrane review of patients with poor response to an initial antidepressant found moderate-quality evidence supporting psychotherapy (primarily from 1 large trial of CBT (Cognitive-behavioural therapy)) added to usual care (including antidepressants) for reducing depressive symptoms and increasing response and remission rates (Level 2) . Hence, CBT (Cognitive-behavioural therapy) is recommended as a second-line adjunctive treatment, with medications, for DTD (Difficult-to-treat depression).

Question 6. What Should be Done When a Patient is Better? > Q.6.d. How Should Antidepressant Treatment be Discontinued? > paragraph id: 175

Up to 50% of patients may experience discontinuation symptoms when stopping long-term use of antidepressants, especially with abrupt stopping. Discontinuation symptoms may include flu-like symptoms, insomnia, nausea, imbalance, sensory disturbances, and hyperarousal (the FINISH mnemonic). These emergent symptoms generally occur within a few days after a decrease in dose or stopping the antidepressant, are mild to moderate in severity, and resolve within a few weeks. However, later onset, greater severity, and longer duration of symptoms lasting several months or longer have been reported (see Box 6.1 ). Antidepressants with a shorter half-life, such as paroxetine and venlafaxine, are associated with a greater incidence/severity and a quicker onset of discontinuation symptoms. Table 6.3 shows the risk of discontinuation symptoms for various antidepressants.

Question 6. What Should be Done When a Patient is Better? > Q.6.d. How Should Antidepressant Treatment be Discontinued? > paragraph id: 177

It is important to differentiate discontinuation symptoms from early symptoms of recurrence since misdiagnosing these emergent symptoms can prolong antidepressant use unnecessarily. Discontinuation symptoms generally have an earlier onset (within days rather than weeks), are often characterized by somatic symptoms (e.g., nausea, dizziness, and shock-like sensations) that differ from those of the initial depressive episode, and improve rapidly if the dose is restored to its previous level. Although gradual tapering of antidepressants may not prevent discontinuation symptoms, they typically occur less frequently compared to abrupt stopping and are less severe. Psychological support may also help with antidepressant discontinuation. Adding psychotherapy may allow patients to stop medication without increasing the risk of relapse and may help mitigate discontinuation symptoms while tapering the antidepressant.

Question 6. What Should be Done When a Patient is Better? > Q.6.d. How Should Antidepressant Treatment be Discontinued? > Box 6.1. > paragraph id: 176

Protracted Discontinuation Symptoms and Hyperbolic Tapering Schedules.
Persistent discontinuation syndromes, with severe, potentially irreversible symptoms persisting beyond 6 weeks, have been described after stopping long-term antidepressant treatment. However, differing rates in the literature suggest that these discontinuation syndromes are heterogeneous, often occur with overlapping conditions, and require individual attention and assessment. In addition, since protracted discontinuation symptoms have mostly been reported in case reports, user surveys and internet forums, more rigorous studies are needed to establish their frequency, severity, and risk.
It has been suggested that, at the lower end of the therapeutic dose range, linear dose reduction may still result in a disproportionately large reduction in serotonin transporter inhibition, which may contribute to severe withdrawal symptoms. As a result, instead of decreasing the dose by a fixed amount (e.g., 10 mg), a “hyperbolic dose reduction” approach has been proposed, which targets a fixed percentage (e.g., 10%) reduction in serotonin receptor occupancy with each dose decrease. However, this approach is extrapolated from receptor studies using positron emission tomography (PET) in small numbers of participants and has not been evaluated in RCTs. The dosing schedule also presents a challenge in clinical practice, as it relies on compounding pharmacies to prepare liquid formulations or encapsulated nonstandard doses of antidepressants to achieve the required low doses. Hence, there is insufficient evidence to recommend hyperbolic tapering schedules.

Question 6. What Should be Done When a Patient is Better? > Q.6.b. How is Recurrence Prevented? > paragraph id: 170

The 2016 CANMAT (Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments) guidelines recommended that patients maintain treatment with antidepressants for 6 to 9 months after achieving symptomatic remission. New meta-regression evidence suggests that extending maintenance treatment for 6 to 12 months after remission adds benefit compared to stopping before 6 months (Level 1) . Hence, the recommendation has been adjusted to maintain antidepressants for 6 to 12 months after remission ( Table 6.1 ).

Early improvement, often defined as a 20% or greater reduction in scores on a symptom rating scale within the first 4 weeks after starting an antidepressant, predicts a later response. Notably, if early improvement is not seen by 4 weeks, there is only a low likelihood of response or remission at 8 to 12 weeks. At that point, the decision should be to either increase the dose or to switch the antidepressant if there are tolerability concerns.

Question 6. What Should be Done When a Patient is Better? > Q.6.b. How is Recurrence Prevented? > paragraph id: 168

Once patients achieve symptom remission, maintenance pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy are both effective strategies for preventing a depressive recurrence ( Table 6.1 ). Maintenance medication treatment can reduce relapse rates by 50% compared to placebo, and flexible dose adjustments are more effective than fixed doses. In recent, large-sample RCTs examining maintaining or discontinuing antidepressants in stably treated patients, medication maintenance was associated with lower rates of recurrence during 1-year and 3-year follow-up, whether or not patients had CBT (Cognitive-behavioural therapy) during acute treatment (Level 1) .

Table 6.1. Summary Recommendations for Maintenance Antidepressant Treatment.

The table presents a summary of recommendations for the treatment of depression, categorized into four levels of evidence. The first line of treatment is divided into two columns: "Line of treatment" and "Level of evidence." The "Line of treatment" column lists the recommendations, while the "Level of evidence" column indicates the level of evidence supporting each recommendation.

The first line of treatment includes the following recommendations:

*   For patients who have achieved symptom remission, using maintenance pharmacotherapy and/or psychotherapy can prevent recurrence.
	*   **Level of evidence**: Level 1

*   All patients treated with antidepressants should continue medication treatment for a minimum of 6 to 12 months after achieving symptomatic remission.
	*   **Level of evidence**: Level 1

*   Patients with risk factors for recurrence (see Table 6.2) should continue antidepressant treatment for 2 years or more.
	*   **Level of evidence**: Level 3

*   Patients with recurrent and severe MDEs should use sequential treatment (adding psychotherapy after stabilizing on medications) to prevent recurrence.
	*   **Level of evidence**: Level 1

*   When a decision is made to stop the antidepressant, it should be tapered gradually, whenever possible, for several weeks or months with more time between dose reductions near the end of the taper.
	*   **Level of evidence**: Level 3

*   For patients treated with medication for less than 4 weeks, the antidepressant can be tapered and discontinued quickly, over 2 weeks or less.
	*   **Level of evidence**: Level 3

*   Psychological treatments can be added before or during antidepressant discontinuation to help patients stop the antidepressant.
	*   **Level of evidence**: Level 2

Note. MDE (Major depressive episode) = major disorder episode

Question 6. What Should be Done When a Patient is Better? > Q.6.a. How is Remission Maintained? > paragraph id: 166

Maintaining remission is an important goal, as the risk of recurrence increases with each subsequent depressive episode. For psychological treatments, booster sessions may be helpful to retain and encourage strategies to maintain remission. Similarly, optimizing pharmacotherapy and treatment adherence will help individuals stay well. This can be done by maintaining the lowest effective dose used to achieve remission and minimize side effects, and regularly monitoring for emerging symptoms and side effects using MBC (Measurement-based care).

Question 6. What Should be Done When a Patient is Better? > Q.6.b. How is Recurrence Prevented? > paragraph id: 168

Once patients achieve symptom remission, maintenance pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy are both effective strategies for preventing a depressive recurrence ( Table 6.1 ). Maintenance medication treatment can reduce relapse rates by 50% compared to placebo, and flexible dose adjustments are more effective than fixed doses. In recent, large-sample RCTs examining maintaining or discontinuing antidepressants in stably treated patients, medication maintenance was associated with lower rates of recurrence during 1-year and 3-year follow-up, whether or not patients had CBT (Cognitive-behavioural therapy) during acute treatment (Level 1) .

Question 6. What Should be Done When a Patient is Better? > Q.6.c. Who Needs Longer-Term Antidepressant Treatment? > paragraph id: 173

While 6 to 12 months of maintenance antidepressant treatment is recommended for all patients, some will require longer-term maintenance because they have risk factors for recurrence and chronicity ( Table 6.2 ). Most risk factors are longitudinal and part of a continuum of exposure to depression and other psychological stressors throughout the lifespan. A systematic meta-review identified residual symptoms and a history of maltreatment or abuse during childhood as robust risk factors for recurrence. Other risk factors, including longer episode duration and greater severity of depressive episodes, have less evidence to support a higher risk of recurrence. Some evidence suggests that prior depressive episodes and residual symptoms could indicate a kindling effect, in which subsequent depressive episodes are triggered by milder stressors, and whereby certain individual characteristics such as early childhood adversity and neuroticism may contribute to a heightened sensitivity to life stressors over time.

    *   Mirtazapine: More favorable in efficacy, acceptability, drug interactions, discontinuation, sexual dysfunction, less favorable in sedation, weight gain.
    *   Vilazodone: More favorable in drug interactions, sedation, weight gain, sexual dysfunction, other tolerability issues, neutral in efficacy, acceptability, discontinuation.
    *   Vortioxetine: More favorable in efficacy, acceptability, drug interactions, discontinuation, sedation, weight gain, sexual dysfunction, neutral other tolerability issues.
*   **Not available in Canada**
    *   Agomelatine: More favorable in efficacy, acceptability, drug interactions (LFTs [4]), discontinuation, weight gain, sexual dysfunction, other tolerability issues, neutral in sedation.

    *   Milnacipran: More favorable in drug interactions, sedation, neutral in efficacy, acceptability, discontinuation, weight gain, sexual dysfunction, other tolerability issues.

Note. These comparative favourability ratings are based on a variety of data sources, including meta-analyses and RCTs, supplemented with expert consensus. 
	Note that ratings show those agents that have more favourable profiles (in green squares) and those with less favourable profiles (in red squares).
	These are not absolute ratings; an agent can be impeded for other clinical reasons despite having a rating as less favourable in a particular characteristic.

Treatment recommendations are then organized along the lines of treatment, based on both strength of the evidence and clinical support ( Table B ). Clinical support reflects expert consensus by the CANMAT (Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments) editorial group on tolerability, safety, and feasibility. First-line treatments require higher-quality evidence (Level 1 or Level 2 evidence) and generally should be considered first in decision-making. Second- and third-line treatments should usually be considered only when first-line treatments are ineffective or unavailable. Treatments with Level 1 evidence for efficacy may be downgraded to second-line or third-line recommendations due to clinical concerns such as safety and side effect profile. Note that recommendations for principles of care (e.g. in Q.1, Q.2 and Q.5) are based primarily on Level 3 or Level 4 evidence, such as expert consensus.

Question 3. How are Treatments Selected? > Q.3.e. How is a Pharmacological Treatment Selected? > paragraph id: 84

When starting pharmacotherapy for MDD (Major depressive disorder), the prescriber has a choice of 31 antidepressants, including 17 that are considered first-line treatments because of robust evidence supporting their safety and efficacy in placebo-controlled RCTs (Level 1) ( Table 3.3 ). A network meta-analysis of placebo-controlled and active comparator trials confirmed that each of these antidepressants was more effective than placebo (Cipriani et al. 2018, in the Key References). The first choice of an antidepressant can be any of the first-line antidepressants, taking into account efficacy, potential for adverse effects, clinical presentation, cost, and patient preference. Clinicians should use psychoeducation when prescribing medications, including discussing risks and benefits, the time course of effect, and dispelling myths and misbeliefs about medication use.

Question 3. How are Treatments Selected? > Q.3.e. How is a Pharmacological Treatment Selected? > paragraph id: 93

In addition to efficacy and tolerability, patient and clinical factors may also be considered in selecting antidepressant medication in some cases, including episode specifiers and symptom dimensions (see Q.3.g). While most antidepressants appear to be effective irrespective of sex, gender, race, ethnicity, and baseline severity, age may be a relevant factor in antidepressant selection. For patients over age 65, SSRIs may be less effective and SNRIs, such as duloxetine, may be more effective (Level 3) . For young patients up to age 25, the balance of efficacy, adverse reactions and risk of discontinuation symptoms may favour using fluoxetine or agomelatine over other antidepressants (Level 4) .

Question 3. How are Treatments Selected? > Q.3.e. How is a Pharmacological Treatment Selected? > paragraph id: 92

Table 3.5 also summarizes comparative ratings for side effects of particular importance to patients (sedation, weight gain, and sexual dysfunction) alongside a category of other tolerability (side effects other than those 3). For sedation and weight gain, results from longer-term observational studies are included in the comparative assessment. Of note is that some treatment-emergent weight gain may be normative, e.g., in patients whose depressive symptoms include weight loss. Treatment-emergent sexual dysfunction, which can affect all phases of sexual response (desire, arousal, and orgasm) is also commonly experienced with antidepressants, particularly in those with serotonergic effects. Based on studies where sexual dysfunction is systematically assessed, several antidepressants (desvenlafaxine, bupropion, mirtazapine, vilazodone, vortioxetine, and agomelatine) are associated with lower rates of sexual side effects. Because sexual dysfunction can also be a symptom of depression, an assessment of baseline sexual functioning is important to identify emergent sexual side effects.

Question 3. How are Treatments Selected? > Q.3.j. What are the Safety Concerns and Drug Interactions With Antidepressants? > paragraph id: 112

The safety considerations of antidepressants are partly age-dependent. While SSRIs and SNRIs are generally safe in adults, the extremes of the adult age range are linked to an increased risk of some adverse events. For example, SSRIs and SNRIs are associated with an increased risk of akathisia, agitation, and aggression in young individuals under age 25 years (Level 2) . The risks of gastrointestinal bleeding, hyponatremia, liver damage, and QTc prolongation are most prominent in adults over age 65 years (Level 3) .

Question 7. What Should be Done When a Patient is not Better? > Q.7.c. How are Strategies Sequenced When There is a Poor Response to an Initial Antidepressant Treatment? > paragraph id: 184

The first steps in the assessment of poor response involve re-evaluating the diagnosis (e.g., a missed diagnosis of bipolar disorder), comorbidities, and adherence to treatment. In addition to clinical reassessment, laboratory investigations should be considered to rule out potential medical factors that can contribute to persistent symptoms and that require additional interventions. Pharmacogenetic testing may be helpful to identify pharmacokinetic reasons for poor response or unusual severity of adverse effects. Systematic, sequential, and MBC (Measurement-based care) may enhance outcomes for MDD (Major depressive disorder) when initial treatments are not fully effective (Level 2) .

Question 7. What Should be Done When a Patient is not Better? > Q.7.c. How are Strategies Sequenced When There is a Poor Response to an Initial Antidepressant Treatment? > paragraph id: 190

For these medication strategies, a comprehensive review of previous medication trials, major side effects experienced, and whether there is a partial response, can inform the decision. Switching should be considered first when there is no response to the initial antidepressant or when the first medication has troublesome side effects. Adjunctive strategies should be considered first when there is a partial response to the initial antidepressant and there are minimal or no tolerability issues with the first medication.

Question 3. How are Treatments Selected? > Q.3.g. How do DSM-5-TR Specifiers and Symptom Dimensions Influence Medication Selection? > paragraph id: 101

The 2016 CANMAT (Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments) guidelines also identified some symptom dimensions not included in DSM-5-TR that may have treatment specificity ( Table 3.6 ). Cognitive symptoms (problems with concentration, memory, and executive functioning) are common in MDD (Major depressive disorder) and medications such as vortioxetine, bupropion, and SNRIs may have superior efficacy for cognitive dysfunction compared to SSRIs (Level 2) . Recent meta-analyses support these findings. Duloxetine and other SNRIs show more benefits for comorbid pain conditions compared to SSRIs. Energy, fatigue, and motivation symptoms may preferentially respond to SNRIs compared to SSRIs (Level 2) .

Question 3. How are Treatments Selected? > Q.3.e. How is a Pharmacological Treatment Selected? > paragraph id: 93

In addition to efficacy and tolerability, patient and clinical factors may also be considered in selecting antidepressant medication in some cases, including episode specifiers and symptom dimensions (see Q.3.g). While most antidepressants appear to be effective irrespective of sex, gender, race, ethnicity, and baseline severity, age may be a relevant factor in antidepressant selection. For patients over age 65, SSRIs may be less effective and SNRIs, such as duloxetine, may be more effective (Level 3) . For young patients up to age 25, the balance of efficacy, adverse reactions and risk of discontinuation symptoms may favour using fluoxetine or agomelatine over other antidepressants (Level 4) .

The guidelines development process is similar to previous CANMAT (Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments) guidelines, with some exceptions. The familiar question–answer format is retained because clinicians continue to affirm its clinical practicality and ease of use. Questions were developed by a core editorial group with feedback from patient partners and organized into eight primary topics representing a patient care journey from assessment to acute treatment and maintenance, including treatment options for difficult-to-treat depression (DTD (Difficult-to-treat depression)). We also incorporated lifestyle interventions such as exercise, nutrition, and sleep hygiene into treatment plans. The evidence review process focused on meta-reviews of systematic reviews and meta-analyses published since 2015 (the literature search end date for the CANMAT (Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments) 2016 guidelines), supplemented by other studies when those were not available. To enhance readability, only selected references are included in this publication; a complete citation list and summary of evidence reviews are available in the online supplemental materials ( https://osf.io/8tfkp/ ).

While acknowledging these concerns, many of these perceived barriers can be addressed. Practical tips for incorporating MBC (Measurement-based care) in clinical settings include using simple PROMs that are free of charge, emailing scales to patients to complete prior to their appointment, and having patients complete scales in the waiting room before the appointment. Mobile and internet apps are also available that allow patients to complete validated scales and track their scores on their own time. For example, Apple has integrated the PHQ (Patient health questionnaire)-9 and GAD-7 into its Health mobile app, so that scores can be tracked alongside other health indicators.

Question 4. What is the Role of DHIs? > Q.4.d. What are Examples of Guided (Facilitated) DHIs? > paragraph id: 143

The most-studied guided DHI (Digital health intervention) approach is internet CBT (Cognitive-behavioural therapy) (iCBT). These programs offer guidance from a therapist or are intended for use by clinicians working with their patients. A recent umbrella review of iCBT described medium to large effect sizes in 4 meta-analyses (Level 1) . The Good Days Ahead program, with therapist or telephone support, was evaluated in 2 large RCTs with evidence for efficacy. Some iCBT programs (e.g., Deprexis) also incorporate chatbot agents for conversational interaction with users. Hence, guided iCBT is recommended as a first-line monotherapy for mild depression (Level 2) , and as a first-line adjunctive treatment for moderate severity MDD (Major depressive disorder) (Level 1) ( Table 4.3 ).

Question 4. What is the Role of DHIs? > Q.4.b. What are Best Practices for Evaluating DHIs? > paragraph id: 138

Access, cost, and ease of use are also important aspects, particularly for users with disabilities or language/literacy issues. While up-front costs for many DHIs may be low, some have additional costs such as subscriptions for extra features or therapist guidance. Disengagement is commonly experienced during a depressive episode, hence, normalizing and expecting this can reduce shame and allow conversations with patients about compensatory strategies. Clinicians can also ask patients about the current use of other apps to identify features which may support DHI (Digital health intervention) use (e.g., gamification, notifications, and social networking integration). Sharing data with a health care provider or a trusted support may also help the user make sense of changes in mood states over time, as well as detect any adverse events.

The table is divided into four rows, each representing a different level of evidence for the use of DHIs. The columns are labeled "Line of treatment" and "Level of evidence."

**First Line of Treatment**

	*   Adjunctive use of guided iCBT DHIs for MDE (Major depressive episode) of mild-moderate severity.
		*   **Level of evidence**: Level 1

	*   Guided iCBT DHIs for mild severity MDE (Major depressive episode).
		*   **Level of evidence**: Level 2

**Second Line of Treatment**

	*   Adjunctive use of self-directed DHIs for mild-moderate severity MDE (Major depressive episode), when supported with guidance by clinicians.
		*   **Level of evidence**: Level 3

	*   Adjunctive use of guided iBA DHIs for mild-moderate severity MDE (Major depressive episode).
		*   **Level of evidence**: Level 3

**Third Line of Treatment**

	*   Self-directed DHIs for mild severity MDE (Major depressive episode) when no other clinical interventions are available.		
		*   **Level of evidence**: Level 3

**Insufficient evidence**
	*   Chatbots and conversational agents.
		*   **Level of evidence**: n/a

Note. DHI (Digital health intervention) = digital health intervention; iBA = internet behavioural activation; iCBT = internet cognitive-behavioural therapy; MDE (Major depressive episode) = major depressive episode; MDD (Major depressive disorder) = major depressive disorder. DHIs must be carefully evaluated for both risks and benefits prior to clinical application (see Q.4.b). The strength of evidence for DHIs is not as strong as for first-line pharmacotherapy or psychotherapy treatments for MDD (Major depressive disorder).

Question 4. What is the Role of DHIs? > Q.4.b. What are Best Practices for Evaluating DHIs? > paragraph id: 134

Many individuals with depression are interested in using DHIs to support their mental health care but they often face challenges when looking for evidence-informed, engaging, and safe DHIs. Commercially available DHIs for depression are often promoted by internet or app store search algorithms, which prioritize popularity and often fail to disclose criteria for efficacy, safety, privacy, and security of personal health information. Positive user reviews may contain anecdotal evidence of utility, but they do not necessarily correlate with expert evaluation. While DHIs developed by academic researchers may be free of commercial bias and have a more robust evidence base, they are seldom publicly available.

Methods > Grading of Recommendations > paragraph id: 13

The strength of evidence was evaluated based on the level of evidence criteria used in previous CANMAT (Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments) guidelines ( Table A ). We assessed the systematic reviews and meta-analyses for quality and risk of bias using modified global ratings from Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation)). The risk of bias for each study was assessed for methodology elements and rated as “Low” (few missing elements that are unlikely to affect the outcome), “Medium” (some missing elements that may possibly affect outcomes), and “High” (many missing or unclear elements, or clear bias in one element that is likely to affect the outcome). RCTs and other studies were considered when systematic reviews and meta-analyses were unavailable, with small-sample RCTs defined as those involving less than 30 participants per randomized condition. We use symbols to denote these levels of evidence ( Table A ) when referencing in the text (see conventions used in this document).

## Query 25
Whar do the levels of evidence correspond to?

### Answer
Level 1 evidence corresponds to high-quality meta-analysis with narrow confidencei intervals and/or 2 or more RCTs. Level 2 evidence is lower-quality meta-analysis, which Level 3 is a small-sample RCT or nonrandomized controlled prospective study, or high quality retrospective study. Level 4 are expert opinions/consensus

Summary recommendations for screening and assessment

* Carry a high index of suspicion for MDD (Major depressive disorder) in individuals with exposure to static nonmodifiable risk factors and dynamic, potentially modifiable risk factors (Level 4).
* Screen for depression using a validated scale (e.g., PHQ (Patient health questionnaire)-2 followed by the PHQ (Patient health questionnaire)-9) in individuals with risk factors for depression, when there are supports and resources in place to follow up with full diagnostic assessment and treatment (Level 2).
* Conduct a comprehensive diagnostic assessment that addresses biological, psychological, and social factors while recognizing ethnocultural diversity, within a longitudinal life-course framework (Level 4).
* For equity-deserving groups in particular, use screening, culturally competent care, collaborative care, and digital health interventions to improve access to and quality of mental health care (Level 4).

Question 3. How are Treatments Selected? > Q.3.l. Can Other Biomarkers Inform Treatment Selection? > paragraph id: 117

A biomarker is an objective measure of any substance, structure, or process in the body or its products that may influence or predict a disease, prognosis, or treatment outcome. Biomarkers such as plasma levels of specific proteins, imaging or electrophysiological measures of brain function have been examined as potential indicators to predict which treatment may work for which person. Inflammatory markers in the peripheral blood and electrophysiological measures of brain function have shown consistent associations with antidepressant treatment outcomes. For example, increased levels of interleukin 8 and the C-reactive protein have been associated with worse responses to SSRIs. Because of the small effect size of these associations, CANMAT (Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments) does not recommend measuring these biomarkers for routine antidepressant selection (Level 2) .

Question 7. What Should be Done When a Patient is not Better? > Q.7.h. What Psychological Treatments are Effective After Poor Response to the Initial Antidepressant? > paragraph id: 211

There are few studies of psychotherapy for patients showing poor response to antidepressants. A Cochrane review of patients with poor response to an initial antidepressant found moderate-quality evidence supporting psychotherapy (primarily from 1 large trial of CBT (Cognitive-behavioural therapy)) added to usual care (including antidepressants) for reducing depressive symptoms and increasing response and remission rates (Level 2) . Hence, CBT (Cognitive-behavioural therapy) is recommended as a second-line adjunctive treatment, with medications, for DTD (Difficult-to-treat depression).

Psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy was recently reviewed in a CANMAT (Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments) Task Force Report. Several RCTs show efficacy for single-dose psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy in patients with TRD (Treatment-resistant depression) (Level 2) . Although these results are promising, they are limited by ongoing methodological issues (e.g., lack of blinding, inadequate assessment of expectancy bias, heterogeneity of psychological support, and lack of long-term safety data). Hence, psilocybin- and other psychedelic-assisted psychotherapies are considered investigational treatments ( Table 7.2 ).

### Answer
While paroxetine is a first-line antidepressant, its risk of constipation is somewhat high, around 14%.  First line agents with less change of constipation include  escitalopram, sertraline, desvenlafaxine, vortioxetine, vilazodone and bupropion.

Question 3. How are Treatments Selected? > Q.3.e. How is a Pharmacological Treatment Selected? > paragraph id: 91

Regarding efficacy, 8 antidepressant medications (bupropion, escitalopram, mirtazapine, paroxetine, sertraline, venlafaxine-XR, vortioxetine, and agomelatine) have evidence for superior response, although these are in the range of 5 to 10 percentage points difference versus comparator medications. Acceptability (all-cause discontinuation rates in meta-analyses) is also more favourable for several medications. For drug interactions (see Q.3.j), fluoxetine, fluvoxamine and paroxetine have clinically relevant potential interactions with other medications. Citalopram carries a risk of QTc prolongation; however, the clinical risk is low, and citalopram has been used safely in large trials of MDD (Major depressive disorder) with comorbid cardiovascular disease (note that escitalopram does not carry a clinically relevant higher risk of QTc prolongation). Most antidepressants have a risk of elevation of liver function tests (LFTs, see Q.3.j), but agomelatine includes the requirement for regular monitoring of LFTs in its product monograph.

Question 3. How are Treatments Selected? > Q.3.j. What are the Safety Concerns and Drug Interactions With Antidepressants? > paragraph id: 110

SSRIs are associated with a modest increased risk of fractures and falls, particularly in older adults. Most SSRIs have few clinically relevant effects on CYP (Cytochrome P450) isoenzymes and have low risk for drug interactions. Exceptions are fluoxetine and paroxetine, which are potent inhibitors of CYP2D6, and fluvoxamine, which is a potent inhibitor of CYP1A2, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4. These antidepressants can increase blood levels of concurrent medications that are substrates of these CYP450 isoenzymes. Combining SSRIs with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs; e.g., ibuprofen) is associated with an increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, which is mitigated with the use of proton pump inhibitors. In addition, concurrent use of SSRIs with diuretics (e.g., hydrochlorothiazide) is associated with an increased risk of hyponatremia, especially in older adults. Mianserin and agomelatine (both not available in Canada or the USA (United States of America)) are the only antidepressants not associated with hyponatremia 7. SNRIs can cause increases in blood pressure and share the risk of interactions with NSAIDs and diuretics noted for SSRIs.

Question 3. How are Treatments Selected? > Q.3.j. What are the Safety Concerns and Drug Interactions With Antidepressants? > paragraph id: 111

A rare but serious adverse effect of several antidepressants is drug-induced liver injury, which can occur up to 6 months after initiating the medication. Agomelatine, bupropion, duloxetine, and nefazodone are associated with a higher risk of adverse liver effects, while citalopram and escitalopram have a lower risk. Mirtazapine has an excellent short-term safety profile but is associated with significant increases in appetite, weight gain, and long-term metabolic risks.

Question 4. What is the Role of DHIs? > Q.4.e. What are Examples of Unguided (Self-Directed) DHIs? > paragraph id: 148

More recently, some self-directed DHIs have introduced artificial intelligence (AI (Artificial intelligence)) to provide interactive feedback and simulate human conversation. These conversational agents, known as chatbots, can be programmed with either predefined responses, usually given by text but sometimes by voice, or free-range responses that are generated by AI (Artificial intelligence) algorithms. Chatbots potentially can provide personalized and tailored components of interventions, such as CBT (Cognitive-behavioural therapy), through interactive conversations while offering a sense of empathy, understanding, and nonjudgmental support. However, the clinical application of chatbots is still at an early stage and little is known about potential risks (such as inappropriate responses) from these AI (Artificial intelligence) systems. A recent meta-analysis summarized 4 trials in adults with depressive and anxiety symptoms; while chatbots had significant benefits compared to control conditions, only 1 trial included the diagnosis of MDD (Major depressive disorder) and the results were graded as low quality because of the small sample size and high-risk of bias (Level 3) . Hence, there is currently insufficient evidence to recommend chatbots and conversational agents for the treatment of MDD (Major depressive disorder).

Management of suicide risk should focus on individualized care, therapeutic risk management, and evidence-based safety planning (Level 4) ( Table 2.3 ). For patients at high risk (e.g., experiencing suicidal ideation with intent to act and/or psychotic symptoms), treatment in an inpatient setting is often warranted. The goals of care should include monitoring the severity of suicidal ideation, timely pharmacological and nonpharmacological treatments, modifying the patient's environment and circumstances (e.g., removing lethal means from the home and bolstering support in the community) and ensuring regular follow-up. The month after both initiating and stopping an antidepressant are periods of increased risk for suicide, which require enhanced surveillance and safety planning (see Q.3.g). In Canada and the United States, the 9-8-8 telephone number allows rapid access to help by phone or text for people who are suicidal or their family members, or for clinicians seeking guidance to help a patient at risk for suicide.

Question 4. What is the Role of DHIs? > Q.4.b. What are Best Practices for Evaluating DHIs? > paragraph id: 138

Access, cost, and ease of use are also important aspects, particularly for users with disabilities or language/literacy issues. While up-front costs for many DHIs may be low, some have additional costs such as subscriptions for extra features or therapist guidance. Disengagement is commonly experienced during a depressive episode, hence, normalizing and expecting this can reduce shame and allow conversations with patients about compensatory strategies. Clinicians can also ask patients about the current use of other apps to identify features which may support DHI (Digital health intervention) use (e.g., gamification, notifications, and social networking integration). Sharing data with a health care provider or a trusted support may also help the user make sense of changes in mood states over time, as well as detect any adverse events.

## Query 30
How do I know if an antidepressant is working?

### Answer
The guidelines recommend the use of measurement-based care, which involves the routine use of validated outcome scales which are reviewed the pateints, and are used alongside clinical assesement to support collaborative decision-making. Examples of validated scales include patient-rated scales like the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), and clinican-rated scalces such as the Hamilton DEpression Rating Scale (HAM-D).

Question 6. What Should be Done When a Patient is Better? > Q.6.d. How Should Antidepressant Treatment be Discontinued? > paragraph id: 175

Up to 50% of patients may experience discontinuation symptoms when stopping long-term use of antidepressants, especially with abrupt stopping. Discontinuation symptoms may include flu-like symptoms, insomnia, nausea, imbalance, sensory disturbances, and hyperarousal (the FINISH mnemonic). These emergent symptoms generally occur within a few days after a decrease in dose or stopping the antidepressant, are mild to moderate in severity, and resolve within a few weeks. However, later onset, greater severity, and longer duration of symptoms lasting several months or longer have been reported (see Box 6.1 ). Antidepressants with a shorter half-life, such as paroxetine and venlafaxine, are associated with a greater incidence/severity and a quicker onset of discontinuation symptoms. Table 6.3 shows the risk of discontinuation symptoms for various antidepressants.

Question 7. What Should be Done When a Patient is not Better? > Q.7.d. When and how Should Antidepressants be Switched? > paragraph id: 191

Early improvement, often defined as a 20% or greater reduction in scores on a symptom rating scale within the first 4 weeks after starting an antidepressant, predicts a later response. Notably, if early improvement is not seen by 4 weeks, there is only a low likelihood of response or remission at 8 to 12 weeks. At that point, the decision should be to either increase the dose or to switch the antidepressant if there are tolerability concerns.

Question 6. What Should be Done When a Patient is Better? > Q.6.d. How Should Antidepressant Treatment be Discontinued? > Box 6.1. > paragraph id: 176

Protracted Discontinuation Symptoms and Hyperbolic Tapering Schedules.
Persistent discontinuation syndromes, with severe, potentially irreversible symptoms persisting beyond 6 weeks, have been described after stopping long-term antidepressant treatment. However, differing rates in the literature suggest that these discontinuation syndromes are heterogeneous, often occur with overlapping conditions, and require individual attention and assessment. In addition, since protracted discontinuation symptoms have mostly been reported in case reports, user surveys and internet forums, more rigorous studies are needed to establish their frequency, severity, and risk.
It has been suggested that, at the lower end of the therapeutic dose range, linear dose reduction may still result in a disproportionately large reduction in serotonin transporter inhibition, which may contribute to severe withdrawal symptoms. As a result, instead of decreasing the dose by a fixed amount (e.g., 10 mg), a “hyperbolic dose reduction” approach has been proposed, which targets a fixed percentage (e.g., 10%) reduction in serotonin receptor occupancy with each dose decrease. However, this approach is extrapolated from receptor studies using positron emission tomography (PET) in small numbers of participants and has not been evaluated in RCTs. The dosing schedule also presents a challenge in clinical practice, as it relies on compounding pharmacies to prepare liquid formulations or encapsulated nonstandard doses of antidepressants to achieve the required low doses. Hence, there is insufficient evidence to recommend hyperbolic tapering schedules.

## Query 31
When a patient is better, how long should they continue their antidepressant for?

### Answer
We recommend that antidepressents be maintained for 6 to 12 months after a patient achieves remission unless a patient has risk factors for the recurrence of depressive factors, in which case treatment should be continued for 2 years or more. These risk factors include residual symptoms, chronic depressive episodes, medical comorbidities, greater number of previous episodes, poor social support, or persistent stressful life events.

Question 6. What Should be Done When a Patient is Better? > Q.6.b. How is Recurrence Prevented? > paragraph id: 170

The 2016 CANMAT (Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments) guidelines recommended that patients maintain treatment with antidepressants for 6 to 9 months after achieving symptomatic remission. New meta-regression evidence suggests that extending maintenance treatment for 6 to 12 months after remission adds benefit compared to stopping before 6 months (Level 1) . Hence, the recommendation has been adjusted to maintain antidepressants for 6 to 12 months after remission ( Table 6.1 ).

Question 6. What Should be Done When a Patient is Better? > Q.6.d. How Should Antidepressant Treatment be Discontinued? > paragraph id: 179

Given the uncertainty about discontinuation strategies, CANMAT (Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments) recommends a pragmatic approach. Unless there are clinical reasons requiring rapid discontinuation (e.g., serious side effects, serotonin syndrome, etc.), antidepressants should be tapered gradually over several weeks or months (except for fluoxetine, which does not need tapering because of its long half-life), extending the time between dose reductions towards the end of the taper (Level 3) . In situations where antidepressants have been used for less than 4 weeks (e.g., a decision to stop the medication because of side effects), a fast-tapering schedule over 2 weeks or less can be used (Level 3) . Psychological treatments may also be used during or preceding antidepressant discontinuation, if available and acceptable to the patient, to reduce or mitigate discontinuation effects (Level 2) . If discontinuation symptoms are severe when the dose is decreased, patients can return to the previous higher dose, with a slower tapering schedule used subsequently. Alternatively, SSRI (Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) and SNRI (Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor) antidepressants can be switched to a long-acting medication such as fluoxetine, which can then be tapered. During antidepressant tapering, patients should be monitored using a validated measure such as the Discontinuation-Emergent Signs and Symptoms (DESS) Scale (Level 3) .

Table 6.1. Summary Recommendations for Maintenance Antidepressant Treatment.

The table presents a summary of recommendations for the treatment of depression, categorized into four levels of evidence. The first line of treatment is divided into two columns: "Line of treatment" and "Level of evidence." The "Line of treatment" column lists the recommendations, while the "Level of evidence" column indicates the level of evidence supporting each recommendation.

The first line of treatment includes the following recommendations:

*   For patients who have achieved symptom remission, using maintenance pharmacotherapy and/or psychotherapy can prevent recurrence.
	*   **Level of evidence**: Level 1

*   All patients treated with antidepressants should continue medication treatment for a minimum of 6 to 12 months after achieving symptomatic remission.
	*   **Level of evidence**: Level 1

*   Patients with risk factors for recurrence (see Table 6.2) should continue antidepressant treatment for 2 years or more.
	*   **Level of evidence**: Level 3

*   Patients with recurrent and severe MDEs should use sequential treatment (adding psychotherapy after stabilizing on medications) to prevent recurrence.
	*   **Level of evidence**: Level 1

*   When a decision is made to stop the antidepressant, it should be tapered gradually, whenever possible, for several weeks or months with more time between dose reductions near the end of the taper.
	*   **Level of evidence**: Level 3

*   For patients treated with medication for less than 4 weeks, the antidepressant can be tapered and discontinued quickly, over 2 weeks or less.
	*   **Level of evidence**: Level 3

*   Psychological treatments can be added before or during antidepressant discontinuation to help patients stop the antidepressant.

Question 3. How are Treatments Selected? > Q.3.e. How is a Pharmacological Treatment Selected? > paragraph id: 91

Regarding efficacy, 8 antidepressant medications (bupropion, escitalopram, mirtazapine, paroxetine, sertraline, venlafaxine-XR, vortioxetine, and agomelatine) have evidence for superior response, although these are in the range of 5 to 10 percentage points difference versus comparator medications. Acceptability (all-cause discontinuation rates in meta-analyses) is also more favourable for several medications. For drug interactions (see Q.3.j), fluoxetine, fluvoxamine and paroxetine have clinically relevant potential interactions with other medications. Citalopram carries a risk of QTc prolongation; however, the clinical risk is low, and citalopram has been used safely in large trials of MDD (Major depressive disorder) with comorbid cardiovascular disease (note that escitalopram does not carry a clinically relevant higher risk of QTc prolongation). Most antidepressants have a risk of elevation of liver function tests (LFTs, see Q.3.j), but agomelatine includes the requirement for regular monitoring of LFTs in its product monograph.

A rare but serious adverse effect of several antidepressants is drug-induced liver injury, which can occur up to 6 months after initiating the medication. Agomelatine, bupropion, duloxetine, and nefazodone are associated with a higher risk of adverse liver effects, while citalopram and escitalopram have a lower risk. Mirtazapine has an excellent short-term safety profile but is associated with significant increases in appetite, weight gain, and long-term metabolic risks.

## Query 33
I am considering referring my patient to ECT for their depression. Would I need to stop their medications?

### Answer
Antidepressants and other medications can usually be continued during ECT treatment. A meta-analysis found that concurrent use of antidepressants during a course of ECT improved outcomes, but this was low-quality evidence based on older trials. Some concomitant medications may interfere with ECT efficacy (e.g., benzodiazepines and anticonvulsant medications) or worsen cognitive side effects (lithium and cannabis), and should be discontinued or held before ECT.

Question 8. When Should Neuromodulation Treatments be Used? > Q.8.b. What Noninvasive Neuromodulation Treatments are Available? > Electroconvulsive Therapy > paragraph id: 215

ECT (Electroconvulsive therapy) has demonstrated evidence of efficacy and tolerability in the treatment of depressive episodes, with response rates ranging from 65% to 75% (Level 1) . ECT (Electroconvulsive therapy) may be especially effective in older patients, those with psychotic or catatonic features, and more severely depressed patients. Importantly, results of retrospective cohort analyses conclude that the benefits of ECT (Electroconvulsive therapy) outweigh the risks among hospitalized MDD (Major depressive disorder) patients, with no evidence of increased risk of serious medical events. Furthermore, ECT (Electroconvulsive therapy) significantly reduced the risk of suicide in the year after discharge from hospital.

Question 3. How are Treatments Selected? > Q.3.a. How is the Initial Treatment Selected? > paragraph id: 74

In severe cases of MDE (Major depressive episode) with high safety risk and without psychotic features, CANMAT (Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments) recommends the combination of antidepressant medication and psychotherapy, either started at the same time or in a staggered fashion as planned sequential treatment (Level 2) (see Q.3.b). For severe MDE (Major depressive episode) with psychotic symptoms, the combination of an antidepressant and an atypical antipsychotic (serotonin-dopamine activity modulator) is recommended; structured psychotherapy should not be considered until psychotic symptoms subside (Level 1) . In the most severe MDEs and/or in life-threatening situations (e.g., severe suicide risk and physical deterioration), electroconvulsive therapy (ECT (Electroconvulsive therapy)) should be considered as the first-choice option (Level 3) .

Question 8. When Should Neuromodulation Treatments be Used? > Q.8.b. What Noninvasive Neuromodulation Treatments are Available? > Electroconvulsive Therapy > paragraph id: 214

ECT (Electroconvulsive therapy) involves the delivery of an electrical stimulus via electrodes placed on the scalp, resulting in the induction of a brief generalized seizure. ECT (Electroconvulsive therapy) is delivered under general anaesthesia and after a muscle relaxant has been administered to minimize the physical manifestations of the seizure and its potential complications. ECT (Electroconvulsive therapy) remains one of the most effective treatment options for patients with TRD (Treatment-resistant depression). However, the clinical use of ECT (Electroconvulsive therapy) is often hindered by stigma, the need for general anaesthesia, concern about cognitive adverse effects, and high rates of relapse after acute treatment.

Table A. CANMAT (Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments) Criteria for Level of Evidence.

Row 0 - Level of evidence [a]: Level 1, Symbol: Full green-filled circle, Criteria: High-quality meta-analysis with narrow confidence intervals and/or 2 or more RCTs with adequate sample size [b], preferably placebo-controlled.

Row 1 - Level of evidence [a]: Level 2, Symbol: 3/4 green-filled circle, Criteria: Lower-quality meta-analysis with wide confidence intervals and/or 1 or more RCTs with adequate sample size.

Row 2 - Level of evidence [a]: Level 3, Symbol: 1/2 green-filled circle, Criteria: Small-sample [b] RCTs or nonrandomized, controlled prospective studies or high-quality retrospective studies.

Row 3 - Level of evidence [a]: Level 4, Symbol: 1/4 green-filled circle, Criteria: Expert opinion/consensus.

Note. RCT (Randomized controlled trial) = randomized controlled trial.

[a] Note that Levels 1 and 2 evidence refer specifically to treatment studies in which randomized comparisons are available. Recommendations involving epidemiological data or risk factors primarily arise from observational studies, which are regarded as Level 3 evidence. Higher order recommendations (e.g., principles of care) often reflect judgment of the strength of evidence from various data sources and therefore are primarily Level 3 or Level 4 evidence.

[b] Adequate sample size defined as ≥30 participants per randomized condition; small-sample defined as <30 participants per randomized condition.
