Question 2. What are the Principles for Depression Management? > Q.2.f. What Lifestyle Interventions are Effective? > paragraph id: 64

Exposure to natural light is important for maintaining circadian rhythmicity. Light therapy is a chronobiological intervention in which a device delivers timed exposure to supplemental bright light. A typical protocol for light therapy uses 10,000 lux fluorescent white light for 30 min daily in the morning, shortly after awakening. Light therapy continues to be recommended as first-line monotherapy for seasonal (winter) depression (seasonal pattern course specifier in DSM-5-TR) with several consistent supportive meta-analyses (Level 1) . Despite some heterogeneity, recent meta-analyses also find efficacy for light therapy in nonseasonal MDD (Major depressive disorder) (Level 2) , with larger effects when light therapy is combined with antidepressants. This evidence places bright light therapy as a second-line treatment for mild severity nonseasonal MDD (Major depressive disorder) and as adjunctive treatment with medications for moderate severity nonseasonal MDD (Major depressive disorder) ( Table 2.4 and Table 3.7 ).

Question 2. What are the Principles for Depression Management? > Q.2.f. What Lifestyle Interventions are Effective? > paragraph id: 61

The CANMAT (Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments) 2016 guidelines noted substantial evidence for the efficacy of exercise as a treatment for MDD (Major depressive disorder) (Level 2) . While recognizing heterogeneity in RCT (Randomized controlled trial) methods, recent meta-analyses continue to show that adjunctive exercise is superior to no treatment and treatment as usual conditions in MDD (Major depressive disorder), with medium to large effects (Level 1) . Exercise can also reduce suicidal ideation and has good effects when combined with antidepressants. Meta-analyses show benefits in reducing depressive symptoms with the supervised aerobic activity of moderate to high intensity in adolescents and young adults, with low to moderate intensity exercise in midlife and older women, and with high-intensity interval training in adults. Exercise also provides positive health benefits beyond its effects on depression. Taken together, these findings continue to support the use of supervised exercise (i.e., low to moderate intensity, for 30 to 40 min at a time, 3 to 4 times a week, for a minimum of 9 weeks) as a first-line monotherapy for mild depression and a second-line adjunctive treatment for moderate severity illness (Level 1) (Table 2.4 and Table 3.7).

Question 3. How are Treatments Selected? > Q.3.a. How is the Initial Treatment Selected? > paragraph id: 74

In severe cases of MDE (Major depressive episode) with high safety risk and without psychotic features, CANMAT (Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments) recommends the combination of antidepressant medication and psychotherapy, either started at the same time or in a staggered fashion as planned sequential treatment (Level 2) (see Q.3.b). For severe MDE (Major depressive episode) with psychotic symptoms, the combination of an antidepressant and an atypical antipsychotic (serotonin-dopamine activity modulator) is recommended; structured psychotherapy should not be considered until psychotic symptoms subside (Level 1) . In the most severe MDEs and/or in life-threatening situations (e.g., severe suicide risk and physical deterioration), electroconvulsive therapy (ECT (Electroconvulsive therapy)) should be considered as the first-choice option (Level 3) .

Question 3. How are Treatments Selected? > Q.3.a. How is the Initial Treatment Selected? > paragraph id: 73

For MDE (Major depressive episode) of moderate severity with a low–moderate safety risk, the initial choice is between structured psychotherapy and antidepressant medication, the 2 treatment modalities with the most robust and consistent evidence for safety and efficacy (Level 1) . The choice between the two is less straightforward and depends on context, availability, and patient preference. Structured psychotherapies and first-line antidepressant medications are equally effective in treating MDD (Major depressive disorder) in the short term. Antidepressants may be slightly more efficacious in reducing symptoms of depressed mood, guilt, suicidal thoughts, anxiety, and somatic symptoms during the acute treatment phase, but structured psychotherapy (specifically, CBT (Cognitive-behavioural therapy)), is more efficacious than antidepressants at 6- to 12-month follow-up. The combination of antidepressant medication and psychotherapy should also be considered (Level 2) . Finally, exercise, certain CAM (Complementary and alternative medicine) treatments, and DHIs can also be used as adjunctive treatments to pharmacotherapy and/or psychotherapy, especially when preferred by the patient.

Table 3.1. Summary Recommendations for Selecting the Initial Treatment. [1]

The table presents a summary of recommendations for initial treatment selection based on the severity of Major Depressive Episode (MDE (Major depressive episode)) and the level of evidence supporting each recommendation. The table is divided into four sections, each representing a different level of evidence: Level 1, Level 2, Level 3, and Level 4.

**Mild with low safety risk.**

	* Psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy demonstrate similar benefits.
	* Psychotherapy (if readily accessible) is preferred because of fewer risks.
	* Exercise, certain CAM (Complementary and alternative medicine) treatments, or guided DHIIs may be considered as monotherapy, especially if preferred by patients.

**Moderate, with low-moderate safety risk.**

	* Initial choice is between pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy.
	* Pharmacotherapy is slightly more efficacious in reducing depressed mood, guilt, suicidal thoughts, anxiety, and somatic symptoms during acute treatment.
	* Structured psychotherapy, specifically CBT (Cognitive-behavioural therapy), is slightly more efficacious in the medium-term (6-12 months).
	* Combination of pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy may be considered.
	* Exercise, certain CAM (Complementary and alternative medicine) treatments and/or DHIIs may be considered as adjuncts to psychotherapy and/or pharmacotherapy, especially if preferred by patients.

**Severe, with moderate to high safety risk.**

	* For severe MDE (Major depressive episode) without psychotic symptoms, use a combination of pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy.
	* For severe MDE (Major depressive episode) with psychotic symptoms, use a combination of antidepressant and antipsychotic medication.
	* For very severe and/or life-threatening situations, consider electroconvulsive therapy.

Note. MDE (Major depressive episode) = major depressive episode; CAM (Complementary and alternative medicine) = complementary and alternative medicine; DHI (Digital health intervention) = digital health intervention; CBT (Cognitive-behavioural therapy) = cognitive-behavioural therapy. 
These recommendations are based on the severity of the illness (see conventions) and safety risk (see Q.2.c), but other factors should be considered, including treatment response in previous episodes, patient preference, and treatment availability.
There is stronger evidence for the efficacy and safety of pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy compared to exercise (Q.2.f), complementary and alternative medicine treatments (Q.3.m), and digital health interventions (Q.4.d).

	* Psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy demonstrate similar benefits.
	* Psychotherapy (if readily accessible) is preferred because of fewer risks.
	* Exercise, certain CAM (Complementary and alternative medicine) treatments, or guided DHIIs may be considered as monotherapy, especially if preferred by patients.

**Moderate, with low-moderate safety risk.**

	* Initial choice is between pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy.
	* Pharmacotherapy is slightly more efficacious in reducing depressed mood, guilt, suicidal thoughts, anxiety, and somatic symptoms during acute treatment.
	* Structured psychotherapy, specifically CBT (Cognitive-behavioural therapy), is slightly more efficacious in the medium-term (6-12 months).
	* Combination of pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy may be considered.
	* Exercise, certain CAM (Complementary and alternative medicine) treatments and/or DHIIs may be considered as adjuncts to psychotherapy and/or pharmacotherapy, especially if preferred by patients.

**Severe, with moderate to high safety risk.**

	* For severe MDE (Major depressive episode) without psychotic symptoms, use a combination of pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy.
	* For severe MDE (Major depressive episode) with psychotic symptoms, use a combination of antidepressant and antipsychotic medication.
	* For very severe and/or life-threatening situations, consider electroconvulsive therapy.

Note. MDE (Major depressive episode) = major depressive episode; CAM (Complementary and alternative medicine) = complementary and alternative medicine; DHI (Digital health intervention) = digital health intervention; CBT (Cognitive-behavioural therapy) = cognitive-behavioural therapy. 
These recommendations are based on the severity of the illness (see conventions) and safety risk (see Q.2.c), but other factors should be considered, including treatment response in previous episodes, patient preference, and treatment availability.
There is stronger evidence for the efficacy and safety of pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy compared to exercise (Q.2.f), complementary and alternative medicine treatments (Q.3.m), and digital health interventions (Q.4.d).
[1] The level of evidence refers to the choice of treatment, not to the treatments themselves.

Question 3. How are Treatments Selected? > Q.3.a. How is the Initial Treatment Selected? > paragraph id: 74

In severe cases of MDE (Major depressive episode) with high safety risk and without psychotic features, CANMAT (Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments) recommends the combination of antidepressant medication and psychotherapy, either started at the same time or in a staggered fashion as planned sequential treatment (Level 2) (see Q.3.b). For severe MDE (Major depressive episode) with psychotic symptoms, the combination of an antidepressant and an atypical antipsychotic (serotonin-dopamine activity modulator) is recommended; structured psychotherapy should not be considered until psychotic symptoms subside (Level 1) . In the most severe MDEs and/or in life-threatening situations (e.g., severe suicide risk and physical deterioration), electroconvulsive therapy (ECT (Electroconvulsive therapy)) should be considered as the first-choice option (Level 3) .

Other herbs such as Crocus sativus (saffron), Lavandula (lavender), and Rhodiola (roseroot) have only modest evidence for benefit in MDE (Major depressive episode). A meta-analysis found the efficacy of saffron for reducing depressive symptoms when compared to placebo and as an adjunct to antidepressants. Another meta-analysis on the efficacy of lavender reported a reduction in depressive symptoms compared to control conditions. However, given the modest benefit and the major limitations of the RCTs, saffron, lavender, and roseroot continue to be recommended as third-line treatments in mild illness (Level 3) ( Table 3.7 ).

Question 3. How are Treatments Selected? > Q.3.m. What Complementary and Alternative Medicine Treatments are Effective? > paragraph id: 120

Herbal compounds include St. John's wort, which has evidence for efficacy in mild depression (Level 1) . Caution is warranted when combining St. John's wort with serotonergic medications (e.g., SSRIs and SNRIs), as there is an uncertain risk of serotonin syndrome. In addition, St. John's wort is a potent CYP (Cytochrome P450) 3A4 inducer with risk for drug interactions, which is an important consideration since it is available as an over-the-counter medication. Although maintenance studies and efficacy data in more severe illnesses are lacking, St. John's wort is recommended as a first-line treatment for MDE (Major depressive episode) of mild severity (Level 1) and as a second-line treatment for moderate severity MDE (Major depressive episode) (Level 2) ( Table 3.7 ).

Question 7. What Should be Done When a Patient is not Better? > Q.7.c. How are Strategies Sequenced When There is a Poor Response to an Initial Antidepressant Treatment? > paragraph id: 187

Optimizing the antidepressant dose is an important first step. Higher than minimal therapeutic doses are more effective (to a plateau around the equivalent of 50 mg of fluoxetine) but less well-tolerated (Level 1) . Hence, increasing the dose for nonresponse must be balanced against increasing side effect burden and poorer adherence.

Figure 7.1. Algorithm for sequential treatment after suboptimal response to initial antidepressant medication.

**Start**

Assess factors that can interfere with treatment response:
    - Psychiatric and nonpsychiatric comorbidities
    - Adherence to treatment
    - Other biological and psychological factors which may interfere with response
    - Pharmacokinetic factors (consider pharmacogenetic testing)

-> **Optimize Dose**
    If another therapeutic dose, or partial response to well-tolerated lower doses within the therapeutic range.

-> **Consider Adding Psychological Treatments**
    Consider psychotherapy earlier rather than later in treatment

-> **Switch or Adjunctive Medication**
    Consider advantages and drawbacks for each strategy.

    -> **Switch to Another Antidepressant**
        Especially if there are intolerance issues with the initial antidepressant.
        -> **First Line:**
            Consider an antidepressant with a mechanism of action that is distinct from previous one.
            Consider an antidepressant with evidence of superior efficacy (Table 3.5).
        -> **Second Line:**
            Consider a second- or third-line antidepressant.

    -> **Add an Adjunctive Medication**
        Especially if there is a partial response to initial antidepressant and it is well tolerated.
        -> **First Line:**
            Aripiprazole, brexpiprazole.
            - Bupropion, N e-sketamine/lv
            - Ketamine, cariprazine, lithium, mittazapine, modafinil, olanzapine, quetiapine-XL, risperidone, triiodothyronine.
        -> **Second Line:**
            Other antidepressants, stimulants, TCAs, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, lamotrigine, pramipexole, zprasidone.
        -> **Third Line:**
            Adjunctive transcranial direct current stimulation for MDD (Major depressive disorder)
            Vagus nerve stimulation for DTD (Difficult-to-treat depression)

-> **Consider Adding Neuromodulation Treatments for TRD (Treatment-resistant depression)**
    These are generally considered after one of the switch of adjunctive medication options.
    -> **First Line:**
        Electroconvulsive therapy for severe MDE (Major depressive episode)
        Transcranial magnetic stimulation for TRD (Treatment-resistant depression)
    -> **Second Line:**
        Electroconvulsive therapy for DTD (Difficult-to-treat depression)

**End**

Note. This algorithm refers primarily to medication treatments. Psychological treatments (see Table 3.2) should also be considered when patients have suboptimal responses to an initial medication. Neuromodulation treatments (see Table 8.3) are generally considered after a switch or adjunctive medication strategy has failed (i.e., for treatment-resistant depression). DTD (Difficult-to-treat depression) = difficult-to-treat depression; MDD (Major depressive disorder) = major depressive disorder; TCA (Tricyclic antidepressants) = tricyclic antidepressant; IN = intranasal; IV = intravenous; TRD (Treatment-resistant depression) = treatment-resistant depression; XR = extended release.

Question 7. What Should be Done When a Patient is not Better? > Q.7.c. How are Strategies Sequenced When There is a Poor Response to an Initial Antidepressant Treatment? > paragraph id: 188

After optimizing the dose, the main medication options involve switching to another antidepressant or adding an adjunctive medication. The evidence for the efficacy of switching antidepressants is inconsistent. Meta-analyses show that switching to another antidepressant is not superior to continuing the same one (Level 2) and there appears to be diminishing response rates for antidepressant monotherapy beyond the first switch.

Question 7. What Should be Done When a Patient is not Better? > Q.7.c. How are Strategies Sequenced When There is a Poor Response to an Initial Antidepressant Treatment? > paragraph id: 187

Optimizing the antidepressant dose is an important first step. Higher than minimal therapeutic doses are more effective (to a plateau around the equivalent of 50 mg of fluoxetine) but less well-tolerated (Level 1) . Hence, increasing the dose for nonresponse must be balanced against increasing side effect burden and poorer adherence.

Early improvement, often defined as a 20% or greater reduction in scores on a symptom rating scale within the first 4 weeks after starting an antidepressant, predicts a later response. Notably, if early improvement is not seen by 4 weeks, there is only a low likelihood of response or remission at 8 to 12 weeks. At that point, the decision should be to either increase the dose or to switch the antidepressant if there are tolerability concerns.

Figure 7.1. Algorithm for sequential treatment after suboptimal response to initial antidepressant medication.

**Start**

Assess factors that can interfere with treatment response:
    - Psychiatric and nonpsychiatric comorbidities
    - Adherence to treatment
    - Other biological and psychological factors which may interfere with response
    - Pharmacokinetic factors (consider pharmacogenetic testing)

-> **Optimize Dose**
    If another therapeutic dose, or partial response to well-tolerated lower doses within the therapeutic range.

-> **Consider Adding Psychological Treatments**
    Consider psychotherapy earlier rather than later in treatment

-> **Switch or Adjunctive Medication**
    Consider advantages and drawbacks for each strategy.

    -> **Switch to Another Antidepressant**
        Especially if there are intolerance issues with the initial antidepressant.
        -> **First Line:**
            Consider an antidepressant with a mechanism of action that is distinct from previous one.
            Consider an antidepressant with evidence of superior efficacy (Table 3.5).
        -> **Second Line:**
            Consider a second- or third-line antidepressant.

    -> **Add an Adjunctive Medication**
        Especially if there is a partial response to initial antidepressant and it is well tolerated.
        -> **First Line:**
            Aripiprazole, brexpiprazole.
            - Bupropion, N e-sketamine/lv
            - Ketamine, cariprazine, lithium, mittazapine, modafinil, olanzapine, quetiapine-XL, risperidone, triiodothyronine.
        -> **Second Line:**
            Other antidepressants, stimulants, TCAs, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, lamotrigine, pramipexole, zprasidone.
        -> **Third Line:**
            Adjunctive transcranial direct current stimulation for MDD (Major depressive disorder)
            Vagus nerve stimulation for DTD (Difficult-to-treat depression)

-> **Consider Adding Neuromodulation Treatments for TRD (Treatment-resistant depression)**
    These are generally considered after one of the switch of adjunctive medication options.
    -> **First Line:**
        Electroconvulsive therapy for severe MDE (Major depressive episode)
        Transcranial magnetic stimulation for TRD (Treatment-resistant depression)
    -> **Second Line:**
        Electroconvulsive therapy for DTD (Difficult-to-treat depression)

**End**

Note. This algorithm refers primarily to medication treatments. Psychological treatments (see Table 3.2) should also be considered when patients have suboptimal responses to an initial medication. Neuromodulation treatments (see Table 8.3) are generally considered after a switch or adjunctive medication strategy has failed (i.e., for treatment-resistant depression). DTD (Difficult-to-treat depression) = difficult-to-treat depression; MDD (Major depressive disorder) = major depressive disorder; TCA (Tricyclic antidepressants) = tricyclic antidepressant; IN = intranasal; IV = intravenous; TRD (Treatment-resistant depression) = treatment-resistant depression; XR = extended release.

For these medication strategies, a comprehensive review of previous medication trials, major side effects experienced, and whether there is a partial response, can inform the decision. Switching should be considered first when there is no response to the initial antidepressant or when the first medication has troublesome side effects. Adjunctive strategies should be considered first when there is a partial response to the initial antidepressant and there are minimal or no tolerability issues with the first medication.

Up to 50% of patients may experience discontinuation symptoms when stopping long-term use of antidepressants, especially with abrupt stopping. Discontinuation symptoms may include flu-like symptoms, insomnia, nausea, imbalance, sensory disturbances, and hyperarousal (the FINISH mnemonic). These emergent symptoms generally occur within a few days after a decrease in dose or stopping the antidepressant, are mild to moderate in severity, and resolve within a few weeks. However, later onset, greater severity, and longer duration of symptoms lasting several months or longer have been reported (see Box 6.1 ). Antidepressants with a shorter half-life, such as paroxetine and venlafaxine, are associated with a greater incidence/severity and a quicker onset of discontinuation symptoms. Table 6.3 shows the risk of discontinuation symptoms for various antidepressants.

Question 6. What Should be Done When a Patient is Better? > Q.6.d. How Should Antidepressant Treatment be Discontinued? > paragraph id: 179

Given the uncertainty about discontinuation strategies, CANMAT (Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments) recommends a pragmatic approach. Unless there are clinical reasons requiring rapid discontinuation (e.g., serious side effects, serotonin syndrome, etc.), antidepressants should be tapered gradually over several weeks or months (except for fluoxetine, which does not need tapering because of its long half-life), extending the time between dose reductions towards the end of the taper (Level 3) . In situations where antidepressants have been used for less than 4 weeks (e.g., a decision to stop the medication because of side effects), a fast-tapering schedule over 2 weeks or less can be used (Level 3) . Psychological treatments may also be used during or preceding antidepressant discontinuation, if available and acceptable to the patient, to reduce or mitigate discontinuation effects (Level 2) . If discontinuation symptoms are severe when the dose is decreased, patients can return to the previous higher dose, with a slower tapering schedule used subsequently. Alternatively, SSRI (Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) and SNRI (Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor) antidepressants can be switched to a long-acting medication such as fluoxetine, which can then be tapered. During antidepressant tapering, patients should be monitored using a validated measure such as the Discontinuation-Emergent Signs and Symptoms (DESS) Scale (Level 3) .

Protracted Discontinuation Symptoms and Hyperbolic Tapering Schedules.
Persistent discontinuation syndromes, with severe, potentially irreversible symptoms persisting beyond 6 weeks, have been described after stopping long-term antidepressant treatment. However, differing rates in the literature suggest that these discontinuation syndromes are heterogeneous, often occur with overlapping conditions, and require individual attention and assessment. In addition, since protracted discontinuation symptoms have mostly been reported in case reports, user surveys and internet forums, more rigorous studies are needed to establish their frequency, severity, and risk.
It has been suggested that, at the lower end of the therapeutic dose range, linear dose reduction may still result in a disproportionately large reduction in serotonin transporter inhibition, which may contribute to severe withdrawal symptoms. As a result, instead of decreasing the dose by a fixed amount (e.g., 10 mg), a “hyperbolic dose reduction” approach has been proposed, which targets a fixed percentage (e.g., 10%) reduction in serotonin receptor occupancy with each dose decrease. However, this approach is extrapolated from receptor studies using positron emission tomography (PET) in small numbers of participants and has not been evaluated in RCTs. The dosing schedule also presents a challenge in clinical practice, as it relies on compounding pharmacies to prepare liquid formulations or encapsulated nonstandard doses of antidepressants to achieve the required low doses. Hence, there is insufficient evidence to recommend hyperbolic tapering schedules.

The 2016 CANMAT (Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments) guidelines recommended that patients maintain treatment with antidepressants for 6 to 9 months after achieving symptomatic remission. New meta-regression evidence suggests that extending maintenance treatment for 6 to 12 months after remission adds benefit compared to stopping before 6 months (Level 1) . Hence, the recommendation has been adjusted to maintain antidepressants for 6 to 12 months after remission ( Table 6.1 ).

Question 6. What Should be Done When a Patient is Better? > Q.6.d. How Should Antidepressant Treatment be Discontinued? > paragraph id: 177

It is important to differentiate discontinuation symptoms from early symptoms of recurrence since misdiagnosing these emergent symptoms can prolong antidepressant use unnecessarily. Discontinuation symptoms generally have an earlier onset (within days rather than weeks), are often characterized by somatic symptoms (e.g., nausea, dizziness, and shock-like sensations) that differ from those of the initial depressive episode, and improve rapidly if the dose is restored to its previous level. Although gradual tapering of antidepressants may not prevent discontinuation symptoms, they typically occur less frequently compared to abrupt stopping and are less severe. Psychological support may also help with antidepressant discontinuation. Adding psychotherapy may allow patients to stop medication without increasing the risk of relapse and may help mitigate discontinuation symptoms while tapering the antidepressant.

Table 6.1. Summary Recommendations for Maintenance Antidepressant Treatment.

The table presents a summary of recommendations for the treatment of depression, categorized into four levels of evidence. The first line of treatment is divided into two columns: "Line of treatment" and "Level of evidence." The "Line of treatment" column lists the recommendations, while the "Level of evidence" column indicates the level of evidence supporting each recommendation.

The first line of treatment includes the following recommendations:

*   For patients who have achieved symptom remission, using maintenance pharmacotherapy and/or psychotherapy can prevent recurrence.
	*   **Level of evidence**: Level 1

*   All patients treated with antidepressants should continue medication treatment for a minimum of 6 to 12 months after achieving symptomatic remission.
	*   **Level of evidence**: Level 1

*   Patients with risk factors for recurrence (see Table 6.2) should continue antidepressant treatment for 2 years or more.
	*   **Level of evidence**: Level 3

*   Patients with recurrent and severe MDEs should use sequential treatment (adding psychotherapy after stabilizing on medications) to prevent recurrence.
	*   **Level of evidence**: Level 1

*   When a decision is made to stop the antidepressant, it should be tapered gradually, whenever possible, for several weeks or months with more time between dose reductions near the end of the taper.
	*   **Level of evidence**: Level 3

*   For patients treated with medication for less than 4 weeks, the antidepressant can be tapered and discontinued quickly, over 2 weeks or less.
	*   **Level of evidence**: Level 3

*   Psychological treatments can be added before or during antidepressant discontinuation to help patients stop the antidepressant.
	*   **Level of evidence**: Level 2

Note. MDE (Major depressive episode) = major disorder episode

Question 6. What Should be Done When a Patient is Better? > Q.6.d. How Should Antidepressant Treatment be Discontinued? > Box 6.1. > paragraph id: 176

Protracted Discontinuation Symptoms and Hyperbolic Tapering Schedules.
Persistent discontinuation syndromes, with severe, potentially irreversible symptoms persisting beyond 6 weeks, have been described after stopping long-term antidepressant treatment. However, differing rates in the literature suggest that these discontinuation syndromes are heterogeneous, often occur with overlapping conditions, and require individual attention and assessment. In addition, since protracted discontinuation symptoms have mostly been reported in case reports, user surveys and internet forums, more rigorous studies are needed to establish their frequency, severity, and risk.
It has been suggested that, at the lower end of the therapeutic dose range, linear dose reduction may still result in a disproportionately large reduction in serotonin transporter inhibition, which may contribute to severe withdrawal symptoms. As a result, instead of decreasing the dose by a fixed amount (e.g., 10 mg), a “hyperbolic dose reduction” approach has been proposed, which targets a fixed percentage (e.g., 10%) reduction in serotonin receptor occupancy with each dose decrease. However, this approach is extrapolated from receptor studies using positron emission tomography (PET) in small numbers of participants and has not been evaluated in RCTs. The dosing schedule also presents a challenge in clinical practice, as it relies on compounding pharmacies to prepare liquid formulations or encapsulated nonstandard doses of antidepressants to achieve the required low doses. Hence, there is insufficient evidence to recommend hyperbolic tapering schedules.

Question 6. What Should be Done When a Patient is Better? > Q.6.c. Who Needs Longer-Term Antidepressant Treatment? > paragraph id: 173

While 6 to 12 months of maintenance antidepressant treatment is recommended for all patients, some will require longer-term maintenance because they have risk factors for recurrence and chronicity ( Table 6.2 ). Most risk factors are longitudinal and part of a continuum of exposure to depression and other psychological stressors throughout the lifespan. A systematic meta-review identified residual symptoms and a history of maltreatment or abuse during childhood as robust risk factors for recurrence. Other risk factors, including longer episode duration and greater severity of depressive episodes, have less evidence to support a higher risk of recurrence. Some evidence suggests that prior depressive episodes and residual symptoms could indicate a kindling effect, in which subsequent depressive episodes are triggered by milder stressors, and whereby certain individual characteristics such as early childhood adversity and neuroticism may contribute to a heightened sensitivity to life stressors over time.

Question 6. What Should be Done When a Patient is Better? > Q.6.b. How is Recurrence Prevented? > paragraph id: 168

Once patients achieve symptom remission, maintenance pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy are both effective strategies for preventing a depressive recurrence ( Table 6.1 ). Maintenance medication treatment can reduce relapse rates by 50% compared to placebo, and flexible dose adjustments are more effective than fixed doses. In recent, large-sample RCTs examining maintaining or discontinuing antidepressants in stably treated patients, medication maintenance was associated with lower rates of recurrence during 1-year and 3-year follow-up, whether or not patients had CBT (Cognitive-behavioural therapy) during acute treatment (Level 1) .

Question 5. How is Treatment Monitored? > Q.5.d. What Laboratory Tests Should be Monitored During Treatment? > paragraph id: 164

Routine laboratory tests are not necessary to monitor antidepressant treatment for MDD (Major depressive disorder) ( Table 5.1 ), although some blood tests are indicated in specific clinical situations 7. For instance, liver function tests should be done at baseline and every 6 to 12 months in patients with pre-existing liver diseases, and serum electrolyte monitoring should be considered for older patients (age 60 years and older) as they are more susceptible to hyponatremia with antidepressants (Level 4) . Moreover, when adjunctive agents (e.g., lithium, atypical antipsychotics, and ketamine) are used, lab tests tailored to the specific medication should be monitored. For example, patients taking lithium should have blood tests (lithium levels, electrolytes, calcium, creatinine, eGFR, and TSH) checked at baseline and every 6 to 12 months thereafter, or whenever the clinical status or lithium dose changes. For those on longer-term ketamine/esketamine treatment, periodic urinalysis is recommended to check for cystitis, a potential long-term side effect of ketamine use.

Question 3. How are Treatments Selected? > Q.3.e. How is a Pharmacological Treatment Selected? > paragraph id: 91

Regarding efficacy, 8 antidepressant medications (bupropion, escitalopram, mirtazapine, paroxetine, sertraline, venlafaxine-XR, vortioxetine, and agomelatine) have evidence for superior response, although these are in the range of 5 to 10 percentage points difference versus comparator medications. Acceptability (all-cause discontinuation rates in meta-analyses) is also more favourable for several medications. For drug interactions (see Q.3.j), fluoxetine, fluvoxamine and paroxetine have clinically relevant potential interactions with other medications. Citalopram carries a risk of QTc prolongation; however, the clinical risk is low, and citalopram has been used safely in large trials of MDD (Major depressive disorder) with comorbid cardiovascular disease (note that escitalopram does not carry a clinically relevant higher risk of QTc prolongation). Most antidepressants have a risk of elevation of liver function tests (LFTs, see Q.3.j), but agomelatine includes the requirement for regular monitoring of LFTs in its product monograph.

Question 3. How are Treatments Selected? > Q.3.a. How is the Initial Treatment Selected? > paragraph id: 72

For MDE (Major depressive episode) with mild severity and low safety risk (see Q.2c), evidence-based psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy have similar efficacy, but the balance of benefits and risks suggests a first-line psychotherapy, if readily accessible, as the preferred treatment. At this lower level of severity, monotherapy treatment with exercise, CAM (Complementary and alternative medicine) (Q.3.m) treatments and guided DHIs (Q.4.d) may be considered, especially when preferred by patients. Note that there is stronger evidence for efficacy and safety of pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy, compared to these treatments.

Question 3. How are Treatments Selected? > Q.3.e. How is a Pharmacological Treatment Selected? > paragraph id: 84

When starting pharmacotherapy for MDD (Major depressive disorder), the prescriber has a choice of 31 antidepressants, including 17 that are considered first-line treatments because of robust evidence supporting their safety and efficacy in placebo-controlled RCTs (Level 1) ( Table 3.3 ). A network meta-analysis of placebo-controlled and active comparator trials confirmed that each of these antidepressants was more effective than placebo (Cipriani et al. 2018, in the Key References). The first choice of an antidepressant can be any of the first-line antidepressants, taking into account efficacy, potential for adverse effects, clinical presentation, cost, and patient preference. Clinicians should use psychoeducation when prescribing medications, including discussing risks and benefits, the time course of effect, and dispelling myths and misbeliefs about medication use.

Table 3.5 also summarizes comparative ratings for side effects of particular importance to patients (sedation, weight gain, and sexual dysfunction) alongside a category of other tolerability (side effects other than those 3). For sedation and weight gain, results from longer-term observational studies are included in the comparative assessment. Of note is that some treatment-emergent weight gain may be normative, e.g., in patients whose depressive symptoms include weight loss. Treatment-emergent sexual dysfunction, which can affect all phases of sexual response (desire, arousal, and orgasm) is also commonly experienced with antidepressants, particularly in those with serotonergic effects. Based on studies where sexual dysfunction is systematically assessed, several antidepressants (desvenlafaxine, bupropion, mirtazapine, vilazodone, vortioxetine, and agomelatine) are associated with lower rates of sexual side effects. Because sexual dysfunction can also be a symptom of depression, an assessment of baseline sexual functioning is important to identify emergent sexual side effects.

Question 3. How are Treatments Selected? > Q.3.a. How is the Initial Treatment Selected? > paragraph id: 72

For MDE (Major depressive episode) with mild severity and low safety risk (see Q.2c), evidence-based psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy have similar efficacy, but the balance of benefits and risks suggests a first-line psychotherapy, if readily accessible, as the preferred treatment. At this lower level of severity, monotherapy treatment with exercise, CAM (Complementary and alternative medicine) (Q.3.m) treatments and guided DHIs (Q.4.d) may be considered, especially when preferred by patients. Note that there is stronger evidence for efficacy and safety of pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy, compared to these treatments.

Question 3. How are Treatments Selected? > Q.3.m. What Complementary and Alternative Medicine Treatments are Effective? > paragraph id: 120

Herbal compounds include St. John's wort, which has evidence for efficacy in mild depression (Level 1) . Caution is warranted when combining St. John's wort with serotonergic medications (e.g., SSRIs and SNRIs), as there is an uncertain risk of serotonin syndrome. In addition, St. John's wort is a potent CYP (Cytochrome P450) 3A4 inducer with risk for drug interactions, which is an important consideration since it is available as an over-the-counter medication. Although maintenance studies and efficacy data in more severe illnesses are lacking, St. John's wort is recommended as a first-line treatment for MDE (Major depressive episode) of mild severity (Level 1) and as a second-line treatment for moderate severity MDE (Major depressive episode) (Level 2) ( Table 3.7 ).

Question 7. What Should be Done When a Patient is not Better? > Q.7.g. What are the Risks and Benefits of Specific Adjunctive Medications? > Glutamate Modulators > paragraph id: 202

Newer adjunctive agents target the glutamate system, which is implicated in the pathophysiology of MDD (Major depressive disorder) and has the potential for rapid onset of antidepressant effects. A CANMAT (Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments) Task Force Report summarized the extensive evidence for rapid antidepressant effects of a single dose of intravenous (IV) racemic ketamine, a glutamate modulator acting as an NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptor antagonist (Level 1) , with recent studies also showing effectiveness and safety of repeated infusions (Level 2) . Similarly, several meta-analyses showed efficacy for intranasal esketamine (Level 1) , which is approved by several regulatory agencies as an add-on treatment to an SSRI (Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor)/SNRI (Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor) or other antidepressant, for patients failing at least 2 adequate antidepressant trials.

Question 3. How are Treatments Selected? > Q.3.e. How is a Pharmacological Treatment Selected? > paragraph id: 89

For most adults with MDD (Major depressive disorder), the choice of the first antidepressant is based on the balance of efficacy and tolerability. The previously cited network meta-analysis allows a comparison of differences in efficacy (as defined by response rate) and acceptability (a proxy for tolerability, defined as discontinuation from the study for all causes) among many treatments (Cipriani et al. 2018, in the Key References). In this network meta-analysis, agomelatine, escitalopram, and vortioxetine showed advantages over other antidepressants when considering both efficacy and acceptability (Level 2) .

Question 1. What are Important Issues for Assessment and Diagnosis? > Q.1.f. How can Access for Equity Deserving Groups be Improved? > paragraph id: 45

Finally, telehealth and DHIs (see Q.4) may also provide benefits for equity-deserving groups, as they can address language, stigma, and geographic disparities in service. Systematic reviews have shown that telehealth, delivered in the patient's preferred language with cultural adaptation and cultural matching of patients and providers, improves health outcomes and access to services (Level 3) . Other studies show that DHIs are promising resources to enhance screening and service delivery. However, challenges with digital literacy and technology costs are barriers to the scale-up of digital services for many patients (see Q.4.b).

However, pharmacogenetic testing or plasma level monitoring may be useful in some clinical situations, e.g., when there are severe or unusual adverse effects with low doses of medications, or when there is poor response to therapeutic doses. In these situations, the tests may help identify the small proportion (although this can vary in certain populations) of individuals with atypical metabolizer status and/or unexpected plasma levels (Level 3) . If pharmacogenetic tests are done for these reasons, or if test results are available when done for another medical condition, the Sequence2Script website may facilitate the interpretation of results according to guidelines from the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium 7.

Question 4. What is the Role of DHIs? > Q.4.e. What are Examples of Unguided (Self-Directed) DHIs? > paragraph id: 148

More recently, some self-directed DHIs have introduced artificial intelligence (AI (Artificial intelligence)) to provide interactive feedback and simulate human conversation. These conversational agents, known as chatbots, can be programmed with either predefined responses, usually given by text but sometimes by voice, or free-range responses that are generated by AI (Artificial intelligence) algorithms. Chatbots potentially can provide personalized and tailored components of interventions, such as CBT (Cognitive-behavioural therapy), through interactive conversations while offering a sense of empathy, understanding, and nonjudgmental support. However, the clinical application of chatbots is still at an early stage and little is known about potential risks (such as inappropriate responses) from these AI (Artificial intelligence) systems. A recent meta-analysis summarized 4 trials in adults with depressive and anxiety symptoms; while chatbots had significant benefits compared to control conditions, only 1 trial included the diagnosis of MDD (Major depressive disorder) and the results were graded as low quality because of the small sample size and high-risk of bias (Level 3) . Hence, there is currently insufficient evidence to recommend chatbots and conversational agents for the treatment of MDD (Major depressive disorder).

The strength of evidence was evaluated based on the level of evidence criteria used in previous CANMAT (Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments) guidelines ( Table A ).

Introduction > paragraph id: 9

Throughout these guidelines, all recommendations are accompanied by the level of evidence available to support each graded line of treatment. In addition, clinical support is used to rank recommendations, based on expert consensus from the CANMAT (Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments) editorial group on factors including safety, tolerability, and feasibility, where possible. A rigorous method ensures consensus among the editorial group, and new or controversial topics are highlighted to clarify the rationale for recommendations.

The strength of evidence was evaluated based on the level of evidence criteria used in previous CANMAT (Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments) guidelines ( Table A ). We assessed the systematic reviews and meta-analyses for quality and risk of bias using modified global ratings from Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation)). The risk of bias for each study was assessed for methodology elements and rated as “Low” (few missing elements that are unlikely to affect the outcome), “Medium” (some missing elements that may possibly affect outcomes), and “High” (many missing or unclear elements, or clear bias in one element that is likely to affect the outcome). RCTs and other studies were considered when systematic reviews and meta-analyses were unavailable, with small-sample RCTs defined as those involving less than 30 participants per randomized condition.

Several conventions are used in these guidelines. In the summary tables, recommendations are ordered by line of treatment, followed by level of evidence, and then by alphabetical order. The exception is when treatments are grouped according to a class, such as medication mechanism of action. The symbols for the level of evidence presented in Table A (Level 1 (Level 1) , Level 2 (Level 2) , Level 3 (Level 3) , and Level 4 (Level 4) ) are used throughout the text to show the strength of evidence for statements and recommendations. To improve readability, we provide a selection of key references for each of the 8 primary questions instead of citing every statement. A full set of references is available online ( https://osf.io/8tfkp/ ). Table C lists the abbreviations used in these guidelines.

## Query 26
What are r isk factors for depression?

### Answer
There are numerous risk factors for major depressive disorder. These include family history, history of adverse childhood expereinces, comorbid medical ilnesses, comorbid substance use. There are also social and enviromental risk factors, such as stressful life events, job strain, income inequlity, bulling, sedentary life style, and working night shifts.

Question 1. What are Important Issues for Assessment and Diagnosis? > Q.1.a. What are the Risk Factors for MDD (Major depressive disorder)? > Static, Nonmodifiable Risk Factors > paragraph id: 28

Female sex is associated with a higher risk and prevalence of MDD (Major depressive disorder) than male, especially in youth and middle age; there is no sex difference in prevalence of MDD (Major depressive disorder) in older age. A family history of mood disorders substantially increases the overall risk for MDD (Major depressive disorder). A history of adverse childhood events or maltreatment, especially emotional abuse, bullying, physical neglect, and parental loss, is also strongly associated with a higher risk of MDD (Major depressive disorder) (and other psychiatric conditions) in adulthood. Death of a spouse is another risk factor, independent of age and sex.

Question 3. How are Treatments Selected? > Q.3.l. Can Other Biomarkers Inform Treatment Selection? > paragraph id: 117

A biomarker is an objective measure of any substance, structure, or process in the body or its products that may influence or predict a disease, prognosis, or treatment outcome. Biomarkers such as plasma levels of specific proteins, imaging or electrophysiological measures of brain function have been examined as potential indicators to predict which treatment may work for which person. Inflammatory markers in the peripheral blood and electrophysiological measures of brain function have shown consistent associations with antidepressant treatment outcomes. For example, increased levels of interleukin 8 and the C-reactive protein have been associated with worse responses to SSRIs. Because of the small effect size of these associations, CANMAT (Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments) does not recommend measuring these biomarkers for routine antidepressant selection (Level 2) .

## Query 27
Should a patient on an antidepressant also see a therapist?

### Answer
Yes, when possible, combining psychological treatments with pharmacotherapy is more effective than either alone for acute treatment, and reduces the risk of recurrence.

Question 7. What Should be Done When a Patient is not Better? > Q.7.h. What Psychological Treatments are Effective After Poor Response to the Initial Antidepressant? > paragraph id: 211

There are few studies of psychotherapy for patients showing poor response to antidepressants. A Cochrane review of patients with poor response to an initial antidepressant found moderate-quality evidence supporting psychotherapy (primarily from 1 large trial of CBT (Cognitive-behavioural therapy)) added to usual care (including antidepressants) for reducing depressive symptoms and increasing response and remission rates (Level 2) . Hence, CBT (Cognitive-behavioural therapy) is recommended as a second-line adjunctive treatment, with medications, for DTD (Difficult-to-treat depression).

Planned sequential treatment (adding psychotherapy after initial response to pharmacotherapy) may be especially useful for individuals with recurrent and severe forms of depression who carry a high risk of relapse following a monotherapy treatment (Level 2) (see Q.6.b). In these cases, pharmacotherapy should be continued during psychological treatment.

Question 3. How are Treatments Selected? > Q.3.b. When Should Pharmacotherapy and Psychotherapy be Combined? > paragraph id: 75

Combining psychological treatment with pharmacotherapy is more effective than either alone for acute treatment; combined treatment also is associated with a reduced risk of recurrence. The strongest evidence supports in-person CBT (Cognitive-behavioural therapy) (including mindfulness-based cognitive therapy [MBCT (Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy)]) initiated sequentially after treatment with an antidepressant is established (Level 1) . Psychological treatments may also address residual symptoms of depression that remain after pharmacotherapy treatment. A smaller body of evidence supports adding psychodynamic psychotherapy to an antidepressant (Level 3) . Adding psychological treatment is effective whether the antidepressant is continued or not, but the highest chances of sustained recovery are seen when an antidepressant is continued with added psychological treatment (Level 2) . Hence, for patients with mild or moderate severity episodes treated with sequential psychotherapy, the risks and benefits of continuing or tapering medications should be considered (see Q.6.d).

Question 7. What Should be Done When a Patient is not Better? > Q.7.c. How are Strategies Sequenced When There is a Poor Response to an Initial Antidepressant Treatment? > paragraph id: 187

Optimizing the antidepressant dose is an important first step. Higher than minimal therapeutic doses are more effective (to a plateau around the equivalent of 50 mg of fluoxetine) but less well-tolerated (Level 1) . Hence, increasing the dose for nonresponse must be balanced against increasing side effect burden and poorer adherence.

Question 3. How are Treatments Selected? > Q.3.e. How is a Pharmacological Treatment Selected? > paragraph id: 89

For most adults with MDD (Major depressive disorder), the choice of the first antidepressant is based on the balance of efficacy and tolerability. The previously cited network meta-analysis allows a comparison of differences in efficacy (as defined by response rate) and acceptability (a proxy for tolerability, defined as discontinuation from the study for all causes) among many treatments (Cipriani et al. 2018, in the Key References). In this network meta-analysis, agomelatine, escitalopram, and vortioxetine showed advantages over other antidepressants when considering both efficacy and acceptability (Level 2) .

Question 4. What is the Role of DHIs? > Q.4.e. What are Examples of Unguided (Self-Directed) DHIs? > paragraph id: 148

More recently, some self-directed DHIs have introduced artificial intelligence (AI (Artificial intelligence)) to provide interactive feedback and simulate human conversation. These conversational agents, known as chatbots, can be programmed with either predefined responses, usually given by text but sometimes by voice, or free-range responses that are generated by AI (Artificial intelligence) algorithms. Chatbots potentially can provide personalized and tailored components of interventions, such as CBT (Cognitive-behavioural therapy), through interactive conversations while offering a sense of empathy, understanding, and nonjudgmental support. However, the clinical application of chatbots is still at an early stage and little is known about potential risks (such as inappropriate responses) from these AI (Artificial intelligence) systems. A recent meta-analysis summarized 4 trials in adults with depressive and anxiety symptoms; while chatbots had significant benefits compared to control conditions, only 1 trial included the diagnosis of MDD (Major depressive disorder) and the results were graded as low quality because of the small sample size and high-risk of bias (Level 3) . Hence, there is currently insufficient evidence to recommend chatbots and conversational agents for the treatment of MDD (Major depressive disorder).

Question 4. What is the Role of DHIs? > Q.4.b. What are Best Practices for Evaluating DHIs? > paragraph id: 138

Access, cost, and ease of use are also important aspects, particularly for users with disabilities or language/literacy issues. While up-front costs for many DHIs may be low, some have additional costs such as subscriptions for extra features or therapist guidance. Disengagement is commonly experienced during a depressive episode, hence, normalizing and expecting this can reduce shame and allow conversations with patients about compensatory strategies. Clinicians can also ask patients about the current use of other apps to identify features which may support DHI (Digital health intervention) use (e.g., gamification, notifications, and social networking integration). Sharing data with a health care provider or a trusted support may also help the user make sense of changes in mood states over time, as well as detect any adverse events.

Question 4. What is the Role of DHIs? > Q.4.e. What are Examples of Unguided (Self-Directed) DHIs? > paragraph id: 147

There is limited evidence of efficacy for most self-directed DHIs. A meta-analysis of 18 RCTs found a moderate positive overall effect on depressive symptoms for smartphone-based DHIs versus control conditions, but there was no significant effect in the 2 RCTs involving participants with a diagnosis of MDD (Major depressive disorder). Given the low level of evidence, CANMAT (Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments) does not recommend routine use of self-directed DHIs as monotherapy for MDD (Major depressive disorder), except in cases of mild severity when other resources are not available (Level 3) ( Table 4.3 ). Self-directed DHIs may be more useful when clinicians actively encourage patients to use and complete the program, hence, they are recommended as second-line adjunctive tools to usual clinical care when clinicians provide support and guidance (Level 3) . A pragmatic technique for the clinician acting as a guide is to periodically ask their patient if they have utilized the self-directed DHI (Digital health intervention), and if so, what they are learning.

Table 4.3. Summary Recommendations for DHIs

The table presents guidelines for the use of digital health interventions (DHIs) in managing major depressive episode (MDE (Major depressive episode)). The table is divided into four rows, each representing a different level of evidence for the use of DHIs. The columns are labeled "Line of treatment" and "Level of evidence."

**First Line of Treatment**

	*   Adjunctive use of guided iCBT DHIs for MDE (Major depressive episode) of mild-moderate severity.
		*   **Level of evidence**: Level 1

	*   Guided iCBT DHIs for mild severity MDE (Major depressive episode).
		*   **Level of evidence**: Level 2

**Second Line of Treatment**

	*   Adjunctive use of self-directed DHIs for mild-moderate severity MDE (Major depressive episode), when supported with guidance by clinicians.
		*   **Level of evidence**: Level 3

	*   Adjunctive use of guided iBA DHIs for mild-moderate severity MDE (Major depressive episode).
		*   **Level of evidence**: Level 3

**Third Line of Treatment**

	*   Self-directed DHIs for mild severity MDE (Major depressive episode) when no other clinical interventions are available.		
		*   **Level of evidence**: Level 3

**Insufficient evidence**
	*   Chatbots and conversational agents.
		*   **Level of evidence**: n/a

Note. DHI (Digital health intervention) = digital health intervention; iBA = internet behavioural activation; iCBT = internet cognitive-behavioural therapy; MDE (Major depressive episode) = major depressive episode; MDD (Major depressive disorder) = major depressive disorder. DHIs must be carefully evaluated for both risks and benefits prior to clinical application (see Q.4.b). The strength of evidence for DHIs is not as strong as for first-line pharmacotherapy or psychotherapy treatments for MDD (Major depressive disorder).

## Query 30
How do I know if an antidepressant is working?

### Answer
The guidelines recommend the use of measurement-based care, which involves the routine use of validated outcome scales which are reviewed the pateints, and are used alongside clinical assesement to support collaborative decision-making. Examples of validated scales include patient-rated scales like the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), and clinican-rated scalces such as the Hamilton DEpression Rating Scale (HAM-D).

Question 7. What Should be Done When a Patient is not Better? > Q.7.d. When and how Should Antidepressants be Switched? > paragraph id: 191

Early improvement, often defined as a 20% or greater reduction in scores on a symptom rating scale within the first 4 weeks after starting an antidepressant, predicts a later response. Notably, if early improvement is not seen by 4 weeks, there is only a low likelihood of response or remission at 8 to 12 weeks. At that point, the decision should be to either increase the dose or to switch the antidepressant if there are tolerability concerns.

## Query 31
When a patient is better, how long should they continue their antidepressant for?

### Answer
We recommend that antidepressents be maintained for 6 to 12 months after a patient achieves remission unless a patient has risk factors for the recurrence of depressive factors, in which case treatment should be continued for 2 years or more. These risk factors include residual symptoms, chronic depressive episodes, medical comorbidities, greater number of previous episodes, poor social support, or persistent stressful life events.

For patients with risk factors for recurrence, antidepressant treatment should be continued for 2 years or more (Level 3) ( Table 6.1 ). Support tools using machine learning algorithms have been developed to estimate the risk of recurrence based on an individual's risk profile, to assist clinicians and patients in making informed decisions about maintenance treatments. These risk-prediction models look promising, but further validation is required before they can be recommended for clinical use.

Question 6. What Should be Done When a Patient is Better? > Q.6.b. How is Recurrence Prevented? > paragraph id: 170

The 2016 CANMAT (Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments) guidelines recommended that patients maintain treatment with antidepressants for 6 to 9 months after achieving symptomatic remission. New meta-regression evidence suggests that extending maintenance treatment for 6 to 12 months after remission adds benefit compared to stopping before 6 months (Level 1) . Hence, the recommendation has been adjusted to maintain antidepressants for 6 to 12 months after remission ( Table 6.1 ).

Table 6.1. Summary Recommendations for Maintenance Antidepressant Treatment.

The table presents a summary of recommendations for the treatment of depression, categorized into four levels of evidence. The first line of treatment is divided into two columns: "Line of treatment" and "Level of evidence." The "Line of treatment" column lists the recommendations, while the "Level of evidence" column indicates the level of evidence supporting each recommendation.

The first line of treatment includes the following recommendations:

*   For patients who have achieved symptom remission, using maintenance pharmacotherapy and/or psychotherapy can prevent recurrence.
	*   **Level of evidence**: Level 1

*   All patients treated with antidepressants should continue medication treatment for a minimum of 6 to 12 months after achieving symptomatic remission.
	*   **Level of evidence**: Level 1

*   Patients with risk factors for recurrence (see Table 6.2) should continue antidepressant treatment for 2 years or more.
	*   **Level of evidence**: Level 3

*   Patients with recurrent and severe MDEs should use sequential treatment (adding psychotherapy after stabilizing on medications) to prevent recurrence.
	*   **Level of evidence**: Level 1

*   When a decision is made to stop the antidepressant, it should be tapered gradually, whenever possible, for several weeks or months with more time between dose reductions near the end of the taper.
	*   **Level of evidence**: Level 3

*   For patients treated with medication for less than 4 weeks, the antidepressant can be tapered and discontinued quickly, over 2 weeks or less.
	*   **Level of evidence**: Level 3

*   Psychological treatments can be added before or during antidepressant discontinuation to help patients stop the antidepressant.

**Start**

Assess factors that can interfere with treatment response:
    - Psychiatric and nonpsychiatric comorbidities
    - Adherence to treatment
    - Other biological and psychological factors which may interfere with response
    - Pharmacokinetic factors (consider pharmacogenetic testing)

-> **Optimize Dose**
    If another therapeutic dose, or partial response to well-tolerated lower doses within the therapeutic range.

-> **Consider Adding Psychological Treatments**
    Consider psychotherapy earlier rather than later in treatment

-> **Switch or Adjunctive Medication**
    Consider advantages and drawbacks for each strategy.

    -> **Switch to Another Antidepressant**
        Especially if there are intolerance issues with the initial antidepressant.
        -> **First Line:**
            Consider an antidepressant with a mechanism of action that is distinct from previous one.
            Consider an antidepressant with evidence of superior efficacy (Table 3.5).
        -> **Second Line:**
            Consider a second- or third-line antidepressant.

    -> **Add an Adjunctive Medication**
        Especially if there is a partial response to initial antidepressant and it is well tolerated.
        -> **First Line:**
            Aripiprazole, brexpiprazole.
            - Bupropion, N e-sketamine/lv
            - Ketamine, cariprazine, lithium, mittazapine, modafinil, olanzapine, quetiapine-XL, risperidone, triiodothyronine.
        -> **Second Line:**
            Other antidepressants, stimulants, TCAs, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, lamotrigine, pramipexole, zprasidone.
        -> **Third Line:**
            Adjunctive transcranial direct current stimulation for MDD (Major depressive disorder)
            Vagus nerve stimulation for DTD (Difficult-to-treat depression)

-> **Consider Adding Neuromodulation Treatments for TRD (Treatment-resistant depression)**
    These are generally considered after one of the switch of adjunctive medication options.
    -> **First Line:**
        Electroconvulsive therapy for severe MDE (Major depressive episode)
        Transcranial magnetic stimulation for TRD (Treatment-resistant depression)
    -> **Second Line:**
        Electroconvulsive therapy for DTD (Difficult-to-treat depression)

**End**

Note. This algorithm refers primarily to medication treatments. Psychological treatments (see Table 3.2) should also be considered when patients have suboptimal responses to an initial medication. Neuromodulation treatments (see Table 8.3) are generally considered after a switch or adjunctive medication strategy has failed (i.e., for treatment-resistant depression). DTD (Difficult-to-treat depression) = difficult-to-treat depression; MDD (Major depressive disorder) = major depressive disorder; TCA (Tricyclic antidepressants) = tricyclic antidepressant; IN = intranasal; IV = intravenous; TRD (Treatment-resistant depression) = treatment-resistant depression; XR = extended release.

Question 7. What Should be Done When a Patient is not Better? > Q.7.c. How are Strategies Sequenced When There is a Poor Response to an Initial Antidepressant Treatment? > paragraph id: 187

Optimizing the antidepressant dose is an important first step. Higher than minimal therapeutic doses are more effective (to a plateau around the equivalent of 50 mg of fluoxetine) but less well-tolerated (Level 1) . Hence, increasing the dose for nonresponse must be balanced against increasing side effect burden and poorer adherence.

After optimizing the dose, the main medication options involve switching to another antidepressant or adding an adjunctive medication. The evidence for the efficacy of switching antidepressants is inconsistent. Meta-analyses show that switching to another antidepressant is not superior to continuing the same one (Level 2) and there appears to be diminishing response rates for antidepressant monotherapy beyond the first switch.

## Query 33
I am considering referring my patient to ECT for their depression. Would I need to stop their medications?

### Answer
Antidepressants and other medications can usually be continued during ECT treatment. A meta-analysis found that concurrent use of antidepressants during a course of ECT improved outcomes, but this was low-quality evidence based on older trials. Some concomitant medications may interfere with ECT efficacy (e.g., benzodiazepines and anticonvulsant medications) or worsen cognitive side effects (lithium and cannabis), and should be discontinued or held before ECT.

Antidepressants and other medications can usually be continued during ECT (Electroconvulsive therapy) treatment (Level 2) . A meta-analysis found that concurrent use of antidepressants during a course of ECT (Electroconvulsive therapy) improved outcomes, but this was low-quality evidence based on older trials. Ketamine has not been shown to improve outcomes with ECT (Electroconvulsive therapy), whether as an anaesthetic agent or with single-dose IV infusions given during a course of ECT (Electroconvulsive therapy). Some concomitant medications may interfere with ECT (Electroconvulsive therapy) efficacy (e.g., benzodiazepines and anticonvulsant medications) or worsen cognitive side effects (lithium and cannabis), and should be discontinued or held before ECT (Electroconvulsive therapy).

Question 8. When Should Neuromodulation Treatments be Used? > Q.8.b. What Noninvasive Neuromodulation Treatments are Available? > Electroconvulsive Therapy > paragraph id: 215

ECT (Electroconvulsive therapy) has demonstrated evidence of efficacy and tolerability in the treatment of depressive episodes, with response rates ranging from 65% to 75% (Level 1) . ECT (Electroconvulsive therapy) may be especially effective in older patients, those with psychotic or catatonic features, and more severely depressed patients. Importantly, results of retrospective cohort analyses conclude that the benefits of ECT (Electroconvulsive therapy) outweigh the risks among hospitalized MDD (Major depressive disorder) patients, with no evidence of increased risk of serious medical events. Furthermore, ECT (Electroconvulsive therapy) significantly reduced the risk of suicide in the year after discharge from hospital.

Although ECT (Electroconvulsive therapy) has high response rates during acute treatment, recurrence occurs in 60% to 80% of patients at 6-month follow-up. Given the high recurrence rate, a maintenance strategy should be implemented following ECT (Electroconvulsive therapy), with either pharmacotherapy or continuation ECT (Electroconvulsive therapy). Unfortunately, there is only limited data to guide this treatment choice. Continuation ECT (Electroconvulsive therapy) (administered at increasing intervals from once a week to once a month) shows better efficacy in preventing recurrence after ECT (Electroconvulsive therapy), compared to maintenance pharmacotherapy (Level 2) . However, few medications have been systematically studied for maintenance pharmacotherapy. Lithium, when combined with either nortriptyline or venlafaxine-XR, is shown to be superior for relapse prevention compared to either antidepressant alone (Level 2) . There are no differences in cognitive outcomes between maintenance ECT (Electroconvulsive therapy) and pharmacotherapy. Given this limited evidence, the choice for maintenance treatment following successful ECT (Electroconvulsive therapy) must consider factors such as previous ECT (Electroconvulsive therapy) responses, episode severity and degree of treatment resistance, consequences of recurrence, adverse effects experienced during ECT (Electroconvulsive therapy), and patient preference.
