## Query 1
My patient is interested in lifestyle interventions for a major depressive episode of mild severity that does not have a seasonal pattern. What is the first line recommendation?

### Answer
Supervised exercise (low to moderate intensity, 30-40 mins at a time, 3-4 weeks, minimum of 9 weeks)

## Response
* The first line recommendation for lifestyle interventions for a major depressive episode of mild severity that does not have a seasonal pattern is **supervised exercise**. 
* This should be of low to moderate intensity, for 30 to 40 min at a time, 3 to 4 times a week, for a minimum of 9 weeks.
* **Level of evidence:** Level 1
* **Reference:** [https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#table9-07067437241245384](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#table9-07067437241245384) 
This recommendation is based on high-quality meta-analysis with narrow confidence intervals and/or 2 or more RCTs with adequate sample size, which is the criteria for Level 1 evidence according to the CANMAT criteria.

## Query 2
My patient has a major depressive episode with seasonal pattern and would like to try lifestyle interventions first. Other than exercise, what is a first line option for them?

### Answer
Light therapy (10,000 lux white light for 30 min daily)

## Response
* **First-line lifestyle intervention option for major depressive episode with seasonal pattern (other than exercise):** 
  + **Light therapy** (10,000 lux white light for 30 min daily) 
  + **Level of evidence:** Level 1
* **Reason for preference:** The CANMAT 2016 guidelines provide substantial evidence for the efficacy of light therapy in treating major depressive episodes with seasonal patterns, with a high level of evidence (Level 1).
* **Reference:** [https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#table9-07067437241245384](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#table9-07067437241245384)

## Query 3
My patient has a major depressive episode with somatic symptoms of pain, what would be the first choice medication for them?

### Answer
Duloxetine

## Response
* **First choice medication for a patient with a major depressive episode with somatic symptoms of pain:**
  * **Duloxetine** is recommended as the first line of treatment for somatic symptoms, particularly pain, with a Level 1 evidence.
  * **Bupropion** is also recommended for fatigue, which may be associated with somatic symptoms, with a Level 1 evidence.
* **Reference:** [Table 3.6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#table15-07067437241245384) 
* The choice of medication may depend on the specific symptoms and patient characteristics, but **Duloxetine** and **Bupropion** are generally preferred for somatic symptoms due to their efficacy and Level 1 evidence.
* **Other options** such as other SNRIs (e.g., **Venlafaxine**) and SSRIs (e.g., **Fluoxetine**) may be considered as second-line treatments, but **Duloxetine** is specifically recommended for pain with a higher level of evidence.


---

## Query 4
My patient has a major depressive episode with somatic symptoms of fatigue, what would be the first choice medication for them?

### Answer
Bupropion

## Response
### First Choice Medication for Major Depressive Episode with Somatic Symptoms of Fatigue

* The clinical guidelines do not explicitly state a first-choice medication for a major depressive episode with somatic symptoms of fatigue. However, we can infer from the provided information.
* **Table 7.2** presents a comprehensive overview of various antidepressant medications, categorized by their line of treatment. 
* For the first line of treatment, the options are:
  * **Aripiprazole**: 2-10 mg, Level 1
  * **Brexpiprazole**: 0.5-2 mg, Level 1
* These medications are considered first-line treatments due to their high level of evidence (Level 1) and may be suitable for patients with major depressive episodes, including those with somatic symptoms like fatigue.
* **Reference:** [Clinical Guidelines](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#table26-07067437241245384)

It is essential to note that the selection of an adjunctive medication involves consideration of efficacy and tolerability, as well as potential drug-drug interactions. If pharmacogenetic test results are available, they may help in treatment selection. 

In the absence of explicit guidance for fatigue, the choice of medication may depend on the patient's specific symptoms, medical history, and other factors. It is crucial to consult the clinical guidelines and consider the patient's individual needs when making treatment decisions. 

### Important Considerations

* Minimize polypharmacy as much as possible by reassessing concurrent medications and discontinuing those with unclear benefits.
* Consider the risk of antidepressant discontinuation symptoms when selecting a medication.
* **Reference:** [Clinical Guidelines](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#section8-07067437241245384)

## Query 5
My patient with a major depressive episode of mild severity would like to try psychotherapy. What are the first-line options?

### Answer
Cognitive behavioural therapy, interpersonal therapy, and behavioural activation

## Response
* For a patient with a major depressive episode of mild severity, the first-line psychotherapy options are:
  + **Cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT)**: Although not explicitly mentioned as a first-line option for mild severity, it is noted that structured psychotherapies, specifically CBT, are equally effective as antidepressant medications in treating MDD in the short term and more efficacious at 6- to 12-month follow-up for moderate severity. 
  + Other forms of psychotherapy: The guidelines suggest that psychotherapy, if readily accessible, is preferred due to fewer risks.
* **Reference:** [Clinical Guidelines](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#section5A-07067437241245384) 
* It's also important to consider patient preference and treatment availability when selecting a psychotherapy option.
* Additionally, exercise, certain complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) treatments, or guided digital health interventions (DHI) may be considered as monotherapy, especially if preferred by the patient.
* **Reference:** [Clinical Guidelines](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#table10-07067437241245384)

## Query 6
My patient with a major depressive episode of mild severity is interested in complementary and alternative medicine options. What would be the most appropriate option to present?

### Answer
St. John's Wort

## Response
### Complementary and Alternative Medicine Options for Mild Major Depressive Episode

For a patient with a major depressive episode of mild severity interested in complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) options, the following are recommended:

* **Acupuncture**: As a second-line treatment for mild-severity Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), acupuncture has shown efficacy as monotherapy and as an adjunct to **antidepressants**. 
    - **Level of evidence:** Level 2
* **St. John's Wort**: Although listed as a first-line treatment for mild severity MDE, it's essential to consider potential interactions with other medications, including **antidepressants**.
    - **Level of evidence:** Level 1

Other options like **saffron**, **lavender**, and **roseroot** are recommended as third-line treatments due to modest benefit and major limitations in the randomized controlled trials (RCTs).
    - **Level of evidence:** Level 3

### Important Considerations

- The Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) guidelines suggest that CAM treatments alone are considered only for MDE of mild severity.
- For moderate severity illness, CAM treatments may be used as adjuncts to standard treatments.

### Reference

## Query 7
My patient is presenting with a mild severity major depressive episode. All other things being equal and accessible, what does CANMAT recommend for treatment?

### Answer
Psychotherapy because of fewer side effects, although psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy are equally effective

## Response
* For a patient presenting with a mild severity major depressive episode, **CANMAT** recommends the following treatment options:
  * Psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy demonstrate similar benefits, but psychotherapy is preferred due to fewer risks.
  * **Psychotherapy** (if readily accessible) is the preferred initial treatment.
  * Alternatively, **exercise**, certain **complementary and alternative medicine (CAM)** treatments, or **guided digital health interventions (DHIIs)** may be considered as monotherapy, especially if preferred by patients.
* **Pharmacotherapy** may also be considered, but it is not the first-line treatment for mild major depressive episodes.
* The choice of treatment should be made collaboratively between the clinician and patient, taking into account the patient's personal situation, expectations, and preferences.
* **Reference:** [CANMAT Guidelines](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#table10-07067437241245384)

## Query 8
My patient's depression has not responded to the medication dose I started them on a four weeks ago.  What should I do next?

### Answer
Optimize the dose

## Response
### Next Steps for Patient with Depression Not Responding to Initial Medication

* **Optimizing the antidepressant dose** is an important first step when a patient is not responding to the initial treatment. This involves considering higher than minimal therapeutic doses, which can be more effective up to a certain point (equivalent to 50 mg of **fluoxetine**), but it's crucial to balance this against potential increased side effects and poorer adherence.
* If the patient has not responded to the initial antidepressant or is experiencing troublesome side effects, **switching** to a different antidepressant should be considered. On the other hand, if there is a partial response to the initial antidepressant and minimal or no tolerability issues, **adjunctive strategies** (adding another medication to the current one) might be a preferable option.

- **Reference:** [Clinical Guidelines for Treating Depression](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#section9C-07067437241245384)
- The decision on whether to switch or use adjunctive strategies should be informed by a comprehensive review of previous medication trials, major side effects experienced, and the presence of any partial response.
- It's also important to note that approximately half of patients with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) achieve a response after 8 weeks of antidepressant monotherapy, and about a third attain full symptom remission. Thus, inadequate response to treatment is a common challenge, and patience, as well as a thorough approach to adjusting treatment, is necessary.

### Considerations

* The **CANMAT (Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments) Criteria for Level of Evidence** provide a framework for evaluating the quality of evidence supporting different treatment strategies. This includes considering the level of evidence (from Level 1, which is the highest, indicating high-quality meta-analysis or randomized controlled trials, to Level 4, which represents expert opinion or consensus).
* When adjusting the treatment plan, it's essential to monitor the patient's response closely and be prepared to make further adjustments as needed, considering both the efficacy of the treatment and its tolerability.

## Query 9
My patient's depression has not responded to the SSRI medication I started them on, even after I optimized and increased the dose up to where they could still tolerate the side effects. I haven't tried anything else yet. What should I do now?

### Answer
If available, consider referral to psychotherapy for CBT, IPT, or behavioural activation

## Response
### Next Steps for Treatment-Resistant Depression

Given that the patient's depression has not responded to the **SSRI** medication, the following options can be considered:

* **Switching to another antidepressant**: This option can be considered if there is no response to the initial antidepressant or if the first medication has troublesome side effects. However, the evidence for the efficacy of switching antidepressants is inconsistent, with meta-analyses showing that switching to another antidepressant is not superior to continuing the same one (Level 2).
* **Adding an adjunctive medication**: This option can be considered if there is a partial response to the initial antidepressant and there are minimal or no tolerability issues with the first medication.

When deciding between these options, a comprehensive review of previous medication trials, major side effects experienced, and whether there is a partial response, can inform the decision.

- **Reference:** [Clinical Guidelines](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#section9C-07067437241245384)
- **Reference:** [Table A. CANMAT Criteria for Level of Evidence](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#table1-07067437241245384)

It is essential to weigh the potential benefits and risks of each option and consider the patient's individual circumstances before making a decision.

## Query 10
My patient's depression has not responded to the SSRI medication I started them on, even after I optimized and increased the dose up to where they could still tolerate the side effects. They are not interested in psychotherapy. What should I do now?

### Answer
Since there is tolerability issues and no response, consider switching to an antidepressant of a different class such as an SNRI

## Response
### Next Steps for Treatment-Resistant Depression

Given that your patient's depression has not responded to the **SSRI** medication, even after optimizing and increasing the dose, and they are not interested in psychotherapy, the following options can be considered:

* **Switching to another antidepressant**: Although the evidence for the efficacy of switching antidepressants is inconsistent, it remains a viable option. Meta-analyses show that switching to another antidepressant is not superior to continuing the same one (Level 2 evidence), but it may still be beneficial for some patients.
* **Adding an adjunctive medication**: This involves adding another medication to the existing **SSRI** treatment. The choice of adjunctive medication would depend on various factors, including the patient's symptoms, medical history, and potential side effects.

It's essential to note that the response rates for antidepressant monotherapy may diminish beyond the first switch, and approximately half of patients with MDD may not achieve remission with antidepressants after 6 months of treatment.

### Reference:
- **Reference:** [Clinical Guidelines for Treatment-Resistant Depression](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#section9C-07067437241245384)
- **Level of Evidence:** Level 2, as per the CANMAT Criteria for Level of Evidence, which refers to lower-quality meta-analysis with wide confidence intervals and/or 1 or more RCTs with adequate sample size. 

Before making any changes to the treatment plan, it's crucial to discuss the potential benefits and risks with your patient and consider their individual circumstances and preferences.

## Query 11
My patient's depression achieved a partial response to the SSRI medication I started them on, but the improvements have been less than hoped. They are not experiencing any side effects from the SSRI. What should I do?

### Answer
Start them on adjunctive aripiprazole or brexpiprazole

## Response
### Recommendations for Patient with Partial Response to SSRI

Given that your patient has achieved a partial response to the **SSRI** medication without experiencing any side effects, the following options can be considered:

* **Optimizing the antidepressant dose**: Increasing the dose of the current **SSRI** medication may be an effective strategy, as higher doses (up to the equivalent of 50 mg of **fluoxetine**) have been shown to be more effective, although this must be balanced against the potential for increased side effects and poorer adherence.
* **Adjunctive strategies**: Considering the addition of another medication to the current **SSRI** treatment may be beneficial, as adjunctive strategies are recommended when there is a partial response to the initial antidepressant and minimal or no tolerability issues.

**Reference:** [Clinical Guidelines](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#section9C-07067437241245384)

These recommendations are based on the principles outlined in the clinical guidelines, which suggest that optimizing the dose or adding another medication can be effective strategies for patients with a partial response to initial treatment. However, it is essential to carefully evaluate the patient's response and tolerability to the current medication before making any changes.


---

## Query 12
My patient's severe major depressive episode did not respond to an SSRI, and did not respond to SNRI after switching to it. I tried adding adjunctive pharmacotherapy as well but it did not work. What should I do now?

### Answer
ECT

## Response
### Recommendations for Next Steps in Treatment

Given that the patient's severe major depressive episode did not respond to an **SSRI** (Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor) and did not respond to an **SNRI** (Serotonin-Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitor) after switching, and adjunctive pharmacotherapy was also ineffective, the following steps can be considered:

*   **Re-evaluate the treatment strategy**: Consider switching to a different antidepressant or adding another medication with a different mechanism of action. 
*   **Consider augmentation strategies**: If the patient has shown some response to the current medication, consider adding an augmenting agent to enhance the therapeutic effect.

### Potential Medication Options

Based on the provided clinical guidelines context, the following medications could be considered for patients with difficult-to-treat depression:

*   **Aripiprazole** (2-10 mg): An atypical antipsychotic with a high level of evidence (Level 1) for use as an adjunctive treatment.
*   **Brexpiprazole** (0.5-2 mg): Another atypical antipsychotic with a high level of evidence (Level 1) for adjunctive use.
*   **Bupropion** (150-450 mg): An antidepressant with a high level of evidence (Level 1) for use as an adjunctive treatment.
*   **Intranasal esketamine** (56-84 mg): A rapid-acting antidepressant with a high level of evidence (Level 1) for adjunctive use.

### Important Considerations

When selecting an adjunctive medication, consider the following factors:

*   **Efficacy and tolerability**: Choose a medication with a favorable balance of efficacy and tolerability.
*   **Side effect profile**: Select a medication that addresses specific residual symptoms or side effects experienced by the patient.
*   **Drug-drug interactions**: Be aware of potential interactions between the adjunctive medication and the patient's current medications.
*   **Polypharmacy**: Minimize the use of multiple medications by reassessing concurrent medications and discontinuing those with unclear benefits.

## Query 13
I am about to start my patient on an antidepressant, but I am worried about their likelihood to adhere to medications, and they have abruptly stopped in the past. What medications have the highest risk of antidepressant discontinuation syndrome?

### Answer
Paroxetine and Venlafaxine

## Response
* **Medications with High Risk of Antidepressant Discontinuation Syndrome:**
  + **Paroxetine**
  + **Venlafaxine**
* These medications are associated with a higher incidence and severity of discontinuation symptoms due to their shorter half-life.
* **Reference:** [https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#section8-07067437241245384](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#section8-07067437241245384)
* It is essential to note that gradual tapering of antidepressants may help reduce the frequency and severity of discontinuation symptoms, and psychological support can also be beneficial.
* **Reference:** [https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#section8D-07067437241245384](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#section8D-07067437241245384)

## Query 14
I am about to start my patient on an antidepressant, but I am worried about their likelihood to adhere to medications, and they have abruptly stopped in the past. What medications available in Canada have the lowest risk of antidepressant discontinuation syndrome?

### Answer
Bupropion, fluoxetine, mirtazapine, vortioxetine

## Response
### Antidepressant Discontinuation Syndrome Risk in Canada

To minimize the risk of antidepressant discontinuation syndrome, especially in patients who have abruptly stopped medications in the past, it's crucial to select antidepressants with a lower risk profile. Based on the provided clinical guidelines context:

* **Medications with Low or Minimal Risk:**
  + **Agomelatine**
  + **Bupropion**
  + **Fluoxetine**
  + **Mirtazapine**
  
These medications are preferred due to their lower risk of discontinuation symptoms, as outlined in [Table 6.3. Risk of Antidepressant Discontinuation Symptoms](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#section8-07067437241245384). 

### Reference:
- **Reference:** [https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#section8-07067437241245384](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#section8-07067437241245384)

It's essential to note that while these medications have a lower risk, discontinuation symptoms can still occur, especially with abrupt stopping. Gradual tapering is recommended when discontinuing antidepressants to minimize the risk of discontinuation syndrome. However, the specific approach to tapering, such as a "hyperbolic dose reduction," lacks sufficient evidence to support its routine use, as discussed in [Box 6.1. Protracted Discontinuation Symptoms and Hyperbolic Tapering Schedules](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#boxed-text3-07067437241245384).

## Query 15
My patient who I have been treating on antidepressant medication is no longer feeling any of their depressive symptoms. How long should they be on maintenance treatment for?

### Answer
A minimum of 6 to 12 months

## Response
* **Maintenance Treatment Duration**: The recommended duration for maintenance treatment with **antidepressants** after achieving symptomatic remission is 6 to 12 months.
* **Reasoning**: This recommendation is based on Level 1 evidence, which includes high-quality meta-analysis with narrow confidence intervals and/or 2 or more RCTs with adequate sample size, preferably placebo-controlled. 
* **Reference**: [Clinical Guidelines](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#section8B-07067437241245384)
* **Special Considerations**: Patients with risk factors for recurrence, such as residual symptoms, history of maltreatment or abuse during childhood, longer episode duration, and greater severity of depressive episodes, may require longer-term maintenance treatment (2 years or more) with **antidepressants**.
* **Reference**: [Clinical Guidelines](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#section8C-07067437241245384)
* **Tapering**: When stopping **antidepressants**, it is recommended to taper gradually over several weeks or months, with more time between dose reductions near the end of the taper.
* **Reference**: [Clinical Guidelines](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#table22-07067437241245384)

## Query 16
My patient has had recurrent depressive episodes, and has now once again had their symptoms relieved by the medications I've prescribed. They want longer-lasting benefits and want help with preventing recurrent episodes in the future. What should can I offer them?

### Answer
Suggest adding psychotherapy such as CBT to be sequentially added once the acute phase of depression is over.

## Response
To prevent recurrent depressive episodes in your patient, you can offer the following options:
* **Maintenance pharmacotherapy**: Continue the patient's current **antidepressant** medication for at least 6 to 12 months after achieving symptomatic remission to reduce relapse rates by 50% compared to placebo.
* **Psychotherapy**: Add psychological treatments, such as Cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT), to the patient's treatment plan to help prevent recurrence and promote long-term remission.

The **maintenance pharmacotherapy** option is preferred due to its high level of evidence (Level 1) and effectiveness in reducing relapse rates. Additionally, flexible dose adjustments are more effective than fixed doses.

It's also important to consider the patient's risk factors for recurrence, as outlined in Table 6.2, and adjust the treatment plan accordingly. For example, patients with risk factors for recurrence should continue **antidepressant** treatment for 2 years or more.

## Query 17
I am about to start my patient on citalopram. Is there any monitoring or investigations I should order for them based on the guidelines?

### Answer
ECG to check for QTc

## Response
### Monitoring and Investigations for Patients on **Citalopram**

When starting a patient on **citalopram**, it's essential to consider the necessary monitoring and investigations based on the clinical guidelines. Here are the key points:

* **Routine laboratory tests** are not necessary for monitoring antidepressant treatment for Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) unless specific clinical situations arise [**Reference:**](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#section7D-07067437241245384).
* For patients with pre-existing liver diseases, **liver function tests** should be done at baseline and every 6 to 12 months.
* For older patients (age 60 years and older), **serum electrolyte monitoring** should be considered due to the risk of hyponatremia with antidepressants.
* If the patient is taking adjunctive agents like **lithium**, **atypical antipsychotics**, or **ketamine**, lab tests tailored to the specific medication should be monitored.
* Regular monitoring of **weight**, **glucose**, and **lipid profiles** is recommended in patients taking medications associated with weight gain, according to obesity management guidelines.

### Key Recommendations

* Obtain laboratory and imaging tests only when clinically indicated (**Level of evidence**: Level 4).
* Monitor weight, glucose, and lipid profiles at baseline and every 6 months when prescribing medications associated with weight gain (**Level of evidence**: Level 2).

### Important Considerations

* **Citalopram** has a lower risk of adverse liver effects compared to other antidepressants like **agomelatine**, **bupropion**, **duloxetine**, and **nefazodone**.
* However, it's crucial to be aware of the potential risks and monitor the patient accordingly.

## Query 18
My patient with a moderate severity major depressive episode would like to start a first-line SSRI, but wants to minimize their chances of sexual side effects. What is the best option for them?

### Answer
Sertraline

## Response
* To minimize the chances of sexual side effects in a patient with a moderate severity major depressive episode who wants to start a first-line **SSRI**, the best option would be:
    + **Vortioxetine** or **Vilazodone** are not typically classified as traditional SSRIs but are sometimes considered in the broader category of serotonergic antidepressants. 
    + Among traditional SSRIs, **Escitalopram** and **Sertraline** have relatively more favorable profiles regarding sexual dysfunction compared to other SSRIs like **Fluoxetine** and **Paroxetine**.
* **Reference:** [Clinical Guidelines](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#section5E-07067437241245384) 
    + However, it's essential to consider that while **Vortioxetine** and **Vilazodone** may have a better side effect profile regarding sexual dysfunction, the choice of medication should also be based on other factors such as efficacy, patient preference, and potential drug interactions.
* **Reference:** [Table 3.5](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#table14-07067437241245384)

My patient with a moderate severity major depressive episode has tried an SSRI, without good effect, and now wants to try an SNRI. Their top priority is efficacy, and they are not concerned about any specific side effects. What's the best option for them?

### Answer
Venlafaxine-XR

## Response
* Based on the provided Clinical Guidelines Context, the patient has tried an **SSRI** without good effect and now wants to try an **SNRI**. 
* The top priority for the patient is efficacy, and they are not concerned about any specific side effects.
* According to the guidelines, **SNRIs** such as **Duloxetine** may have superior efficacy for cognitive dysfunction compared to **SSRIs** (Level 2 of evidence) [**Reference:**](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#section5G-07067437241245384).
* Additionally, **SNRIs** show more benefits for comorbid pain conditions compared to **SSRIs** (Level 2 of evidence) [**Reference:**](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#section5G-07067437241245384).
* Considering the patient's priority is efficacy, and they have not responded well to an **SSRI**, switching to an **SNRI** such as **Duloxetine** could be a suitable option.
* It is essential to note that the evidence for the efficacy of switching antidepressants is inconsistent, and meta-analyses show that switching to another antidepressant is not superior to continuing the same one (Level 2) [**Reference:**](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#section9C-07067437241245384).
* However, given the patient's specific situation and priorities, **Duloxetine** or other **SNRIs** could be considered as a viable option for treatment. 
* **Reference:** [https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#section5G-07067437241245384](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#section5G-07067437241245384)

## Query 25
Whar do the levels of evidence correspond to?

### Answer
Level 1 evidence corresponds to high-quality meta-analysis with narrow confidencei intervals and/or 2 or more RCTs. Level 2 evidence is lower-quality meta-analysis, which Level 3 is a small-sample RCT or nonrandomized controlled prospective study, or high quality retrospective study. Level 4 are expert opinions/consensus

## Response
* The levels of evidence correspond to the following:
  + **Level 1**: High-quality meta-analysis with narrow confidence intervals and/or 2 or more RCTs with adequate sample size, preferably placebo-controlled.
  + **Level 2**: Lower-quality meta-analysis with wide confidence intervals and/or 1 or more RCTs with adequate sample size.
  + **Level 3**: Small-sample RCTs or nonrandomized, controlled prospective studies or high-quality retrospective studies.
  + **Level 4**: Expert opinion/consensus.
* **Reference:** [Table A. CANMAT Criteria for Level of Evidence](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#table1-07067437241245384) 
* Note that Levels 1 and 2 evidence refer specifically to treatment studies in which randomized comparisons are available. Recommendations involving epidemiological data or risk factors primarily arise from observational studies, which are regarded as Level 3 evidence. Higher order recommendations (e.g., principles of care) often reflect judgment of the strength of evidence from various data sources and therefore are primarily Level 3 or Level 4 evidence.

## Query 27
Should a patient on an antidepressant also see a therapist?

### Answer
Yes, when possible, combining psychological treatments with pharmacotherapy is more effective than either alone for acute treatment, and reduces the risk of recurrence.

## Response
* **Recommendation:** Yes, a patient on an **antidepressant** should also see a therapist, as combining psychological treatment with pharmacotherapy is more effective than either alone for acute treatment.
* **Preferred Treatment Options:**
  + In-person **CBT (Cognitive-behavioural therapy)**, including **MBCT (Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy)**, initiated sequentially after treatment with an **antidepressant** is established.
  + Adding **psychodynamic psychotherapy** to an **antidepressant** may also be effective, although the evidence is not as strong.
* **Rationale:** The strongest evidence supports combined treatment, which is associated with a reduced risk of recurrence and can address residual symptoms of depression that remain after pharmacotherapy treatment.
* **Reference:** [https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#section5B-07067437241245384](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#section5B-07067437241245384)
* **Session Frequency:** Twice-weekly sessions of **CBT** and **IPT (Interpersonal therapy)** for depression may produce better outcomes compared to once-weekly sessions.
* **Reference:** [https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#section5D-07067437241245384](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#section5D-07067437241245384)

## Query 28
I have a patient who often struggles with constipation Would paroxetine be  a good antidepressant to try first?

### Answer
While paroxetine is a first-line antidepressant, its risk of constipation is somewhat high, around 14%.  First line agents with less change of constipation include  escitalopram, sertraline, desvenlafaxine, vortioxetine, vilazodone and bupropion.

## Response
* **Constipation Consideration**: When considering antidepressants for a patient with constipation, it's essential to choose an option that won't exacerbate this condition. 
* **Paroxetine Concerns**: **Paroxetine** is an SSRI that can have various side effects, but constipation is not explicitly mentioned in the provided clinical guidelines context as a primary concern. However, it is noted that **paroxetine** is a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6, which can lead to drug interactions.
* **Alternative Options**: Although the guidelines do not directly address constipation as a factor in selecting antidepressants, they do discuss the safety profiles and side effects of various medications. For example, **mirtazapine** is associated with increased appetite, weight gain, and long-term metabolic risks, but its impact on constipation is not specified.
* **Preferred Choice**: Based on the information provided, there is no clear recommendation for an antidepressant that is specifically suitable for patients with constipation. However, considering the side effect profiles, **paroxetine** might not be the most concerning option regarding constipation, but its potential for drug interactions should be carefully evaluated.
* **Reference**: [Clinical Guidelines Context](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#section5J-07067437241245384) and [Selection of Antidepressants](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#section5E-07067437241245384)

Given the lack of direct information on constipation, the choice of antidepressant should be based on the patient's overall clinical profile, including other symptoms, potential drug interactions, and individual factors such as age and other health conditions.

## Query 29
My patient wants to use an AI app for thier depression, is this safe?

### Answer
This application is currently using the 2023 update of the CANMAT guidelines, published in 2024. At the time of its publication, digital health applications for direct-use by pateints had limited evidence. Applications should be assede for whether their techniques are evidence-based and evaluated on real-world populations. Other important factors include the privacy and security of the tool, the potential for providing harmful or inaccurate advice, and whether the patient may experience any barriers

## Response
* The safety of using an AI app for depression is not fully established due to insufficient evidence. 
* According to the clinical guidelines, **chatbots** and conversational agents have shown significant benefits in reducing depressive and anxiety symptoms, but the results are graded as low quality due to small sample size and high risk of bias.
* The clinical application of **chatbots** is still at an early stage, and little is known about potential risks such as inappropriate responses from these AI systems.
* **No medication** is recommended in the context of AI apps for depression.
* It is essential to evaluate the evidence-informed, engaging, and safe aspects of DHIs (Digital Health Interventions) before recommending them to patients.
* Clinicians should consider the following factors when evaluating DHIs:
  + Access, cost, and ease of use
  + Features that support engagement, such as gamification, notifications, and social networking integration
  + Ability to share data with healthcare providers or trusted supports
* **Reference:** [Clinical Guidelines](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#section6E-07067437241245384) 
* **Reference:** [Clinical Guidelines](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#section6B-07067437241245384)

## Query 30
How do I know if an antidepressant is working?

### Answer
The guidelines recommend the use of measurement-based care, which involves the routine use of validated outcome scales which are reviewed the pateints, and are used alongside clinical assesement to support collaborative decision-making. Examples of validated scales include patient-rated scales like the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), and clinican-rated scalces such as the Hamilton DEpression Rating Scale (HAM-D).

## Response
* To determine if an **antidepressant** is working, look for early improvement, often defined as a 20% or greater reduction in scores on a symptom rating scale within the first 4 weeks after starting the **antidepressant**.
* If early improvement is not seen by 4 weeks, there is only a low likelihood of response or remission at 8 to 12 weeks. At that point, the decision should be to either increase the dose or to switch the **antidepressant** if there are tolerability concerns.
* **Optimizing the antidepressant dose** is an important first step, with higher than minimal therapeutic doses being more effective, but less well-tolerated.
* After optimizing the dose, the main medication options involve switching to another **antidepressant** or adding an adjunctive medication.
* The evidence for the efficacy of switching **antidepressants** is inconsistent, with meta-analyses showing that switching to another **antidepressant** is not superior to continuing the same one.
* **Reference:** https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#section9D-07067437241245384 and https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#section9C-07067437241245384 

Some key **medications** mentioned include:
* **Fluoxetine**, with a therapeutic dose equivalent of around 50 mg.


---

## Query 31
When a patient is better, how long should they continue their antidepressant for?

### Answer
We recommend that antidepressents be maintained for 6 to 12 months after a patient achieves remission unless a patient has risk factors for the recurrence of depressive factors, in which case treatment should be continued for 2 years or more. These risk factors include residual symptoms, chronic depressive episodes, medical comorbidities, greater number of previous episodes, poor social support, or persistent stressful life events.

## Response
* **Medication Duration**: When a patient is better, they should continue their **antidepressant** for a minimum of 6 to 12 months after achieving symptomatic remission.
* **Reasoning**: This recommendation is based on new meta-regression evidence that suggests extending maintenance treatment for 6 to 12 months after remission adds benefit compared to stopping before 6 months (Level 1 evidence).
* **Special Considerations**:
  + Patients with risk factors for recurrence (see Table 6.2) should continue **antidepressant** treatment for 2 years or more (Level 3 evidence).
  + Patients with recurrent and severe MDEs should use sequential treatment (adding psychotherapy after stabilizing on medications) to prevent recurrence (Level 1 evidence).
* **Reference**: [https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#section8B-07067437241245384](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#section8B-07067437241245384) and [https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#table1-07067437241245384](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#table1-07067437241245384)

## Query 32
My patient has not responded to escitalopram at 10 mg, what should I do next?

### Answer
Assuming the dose is well tolerated, a first step could be to optimize the escitalopram dose to 20 mg.

## Response
* **Next Steps for Non-Response to **Escitalopram****: 
    + Consider optimizing the antidepressant dose, as higher than minimal therapeutic doses are more effective, but balance this against potential increased side effects and poorer adherence.
    + The maximum effective dose is around the equivalent of 50 mg of **fluoxetine**.
* **Reference:** [Clinical Guidelines](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#section9C-07067437241245384)
* **Important Considerations**:
    + Assess for clinical factors that may contribute to poor response, such as incorrect diagnosis, demographic and illness characteristics, psychiatric and non-psychiatric medical comorbidities, and acute or chronic stressors.
    + Evaluate treatment factors, including inadequate dose or duration of treatment, side effects, poor adherence, and pharmacogenetic variability.
    + Regular reassessment is crucial for patients with persistent symptoms, as comorbid conditions may change over time.
* **Reference:** [Clinical Guidelines](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#section9A-07067437241245384) and [Table 7.1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#table1-07067437241245384)

## Query 33
I am considering referring my patient to ECT for their depression. Would I need to stop their medications?

### Answer
Antidepressants and other medications can usually be continued during ECT treatment. A meta-analysis found that concurrent use of antidepressants during a course of ECT improved outcomes, but this was low-quality evidence based on older trials. Some concomitant medications may interfere with ECT efficacy (e.g., benzodiazepines and anticonvulsant medications) or worsen cognitive side effects (lithium and cannabis), and should be discontinued or held before ECT.

## Response
* **Medication Considerations for ECT:**
  + Generally, **antidepressants** and other medications can be continued during ECT treatment (Level 2 evidence) [**Reference:**](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#section10B1-07067437241245384).
  + Some medications may interfere with ECT efficacy or worsen cognitive side effects and should be discontinued or held before ECT, including:
    - **Benzodiazepines**
    - **Anticonvulsant medications**
    - **Lithium** (may worsen cognitive side effects)
    - **Cannabis** (may worsen cognitive side effects)
* **Reasoning:** The decision to continue or discontinue medications during ECT should be made on a patient-specific basis, taking into account the potential benefits and risks of each medication.
* **Important Note:** The use of **ketamine** has not been shown to improve outcomes with ECT, whether as an anaesthetic agent or with single-dose IV infusions given during a course of ECT.
* **Reference:** [https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#section10B1-07067437241245384](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#section10B1-07067437241245384)
