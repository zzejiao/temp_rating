## Query 1
My patient is interested in lifestyle interventions for a major depressive episode of mild severity that does not have a seasonal pattern. What is the first line recommendation?

### Answer
Supervised exercise (low to moderate intensity, 30-40 mins at a time, 3-4 weeks, minimum of 9 weeks)

## Response
* The first line recommendation for lifestyle interventions for a major depressive episode of mild severity that does not have a seasonal pattern is:
  * **Supervised exercise** (low to moderate intensity, for 30 to 40 min at a time, 3 to 4 times a week, for a minimum of 9 weeks)
  * **Level of evidence:** Level 1
* This is preferred because it has the highest level of evidence (Level 1) according to the CANMAT criteria, which requires a high-quality meta-analysis with narrow confidence intervals and/or 2 or more RCTs with adequate sample size.
* **Reference:** [https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#table9-07067437241245384](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#table9-07067437241245384)


---

## Query 2
My patient has a major depressive episode with seasonal pattern and would like to try lifestyle interventions first. Other than exercise, what is a first line option for them?

### Answer
Light therapy (10,000 lux white light for 30 min daily)

## Response
* **First-line lifestyle intervention option:** 
    + **Light therapy** (10,000 lux white light for 30 min daily) is a recommended first-line treatment for major depressive episodes with a seasonal pattern.
    + **Level of evidence:** Level 1
* **Reference:** [https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#table9-07067437241245384](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#table9-07067437241245384) 
* This option is preferred because it has the highest level of evidence (Level 1) and is specifically recommended for seasonal pattern major depressive episodes.

## Query 3
My patient has a major depressive episode with somatic symptoms of pain, what would be the first choice medication for them?

### Answer
Duloxetine

## Response
* **First-choice medication for a patient with a major depressive episode with somatic symptoms of pain:** 
    + The clinical guidelines recommend **antidepressant medication** as the first-choice treatment for moderate to severe major depressive episodes, especially when somatic symptoms are present.
    + Specifically, for moderate severity with low-moderate safety risk, **antidepressant medication** is slightly more efficacious in reducing depressed mood, guilt, suicidal thoughts, anxiety, and somatic symptoms during acute treatment.
* **Reference:** [Clinical Guidelines Context](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#section5A-07067437241245384) 
    + According to the guidelines, the choice between **antidepressant medication** and psychotherapy depends on context, availability, and patient preference.
    + The combination of **antidepressant medication** and psychotherapy should also be considered.
* **Important consideration:** 
    + The guidelines emphasize that treatment selection should be based on the severity of the illness, safety risk, and other factors, including treatment response in previous episodes, patient preference, and treatment availability.
    + **Antidepressant medication** is preferred for its efficacy in reducing somatic symptoms, but psychotherapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), may be more efficacious in the medium-term (6-12 months).

## Query 4
My patient has a major depressive episode with somatic symptoms of fatigue, what would be the first choice medication for them?

### Answer
Bupropion

## Response
* **First-line medication recommendation:** For a patient with a major depressive episode (MDE) with somatic symptoms of fatigue, the first choice medication would be an **antidepressant**. 
* **Reasoning:** According to the clinical guidelines, for MDE of moderate severity with a low-moderate safety risk, the initial choice is between structured psychotherapy and **antidepressant medication**. The guidelines suggest that **antidepressants** may be slightly more efficacious in reducing symptoms of depressed mood, guilt, suicidal thoughts, anxiety, and somatic symptoms during the acute treatment phase.
* **Reference:** [Clinical Guidelines Context](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#section5A-07067437241245384) 
* **Specifically:** The paragraph from section Question 3. How are Treatments Selected? > Q.3.a. How is the Initial Treatment Selected? > paragraph id: 73, states that "The choice between the two is less straightforward and depends on context, availability, and patient preference. Structured psychotherapies and first-line **antidepressant medications** are equally effective in treating MDD (Major depressive disorder) in the short term. **Antidepressants** may be slightly more efficacious in reducing symptoms of depressed mood, guilt, suicidal thoughts, anxiety, and somatic symptoms during the acute treatment phase..." 
* **Medication options:** Although the guidelines do not specify a particular **antidepressant**, common first-line options for MDE include **Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs)**, such as **fluoxetine** or **sertraline**, or **Serotonin-Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors (SNRIs)**, such as **venlafaxine** or **duloxetine**. However, the choice of medication should be individualized based on patient-specific factors, such as medical history, comorbidities, and personal preferences.

## Query 5
My patient with a major depressive episode of mild severity would like to try psychotherapy. What are the first-line options?

### Answer
Cognitive behavioural therapy, interpersonal therapy, and behavioural activation

## Response
* **First-line psychotherapy options** for a patient with a major depressive episode of mild severity include:
  + Cognitive-behavioural therapy (**CBT**)
  + Other forms of structured psychotherapy
* These options are preferred because they have similar efficacy to pharmacotherapy but with fewer risks.
* **Reference:** [Clinical Guidelines](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#section5A-07067437241245384) 
* Additionally, **exercise**, certain **complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) treatments**, or **guided digital health interventions (DHIIs)** may be considered as monotherapy, especially if preferred by the patient.
* **Reference:** [Table 3.1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#table10-07067437241245384) 
* It is essential to consider factors such as treatment response in previous episodes, patient preference, and treatment availability when selecting the initial treatment.
* **Reference:** [Clinical Guidelines](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#section5A-07067437241245384)

## Query 6
My patient with a major depressive episode of mild severity is interested in complementary and alternative medicine options. What would be the most appropriate option to present?

### Answer
St. John's Wort

## Response
### Recommended Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) Options for Mild Major Depressive Episode (MDE)

* **First-line treatment:** 
  + **St. John's wort** for MDE of mild severity, with a **Level of evidence: Level 1**. 
  - **Reference:** [https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#table16-07067437241245384](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#table16-07067437241245384)
  - **Important consideration:** Caution is warranted when combining **St. John's wort** with serotonergic medications (e.g., SSRIs and SNRIs) due to the uncertain risk of serotonin syndrome, and it is a potent CYP (Cytochrome P450) 3A4 inducer with a risk for drug interactions.
  
### Rationale for Recommendation
The recommendation for **St. John's wort** as a first-line treatment for mild MDE is based on its high level of evidence (Level 1), which includes high-quality meta-analysis with narrow confidence intervals and/or 2 or more RCTs with adequate sample size, preferably placebo-controlled.
- **Reference:** [https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#table1-07067437241245384](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#table1-07067437241245384)

### Additional Considerations
While other options like **acupuncture**, **L-methyl folate**, **SAM-e**, **DHEA**, **omega-3 fatty acids**, **saffron**, **lavender**, and **roseroot** are mentioned, they are either second-line or third-line treatments with lower levels of evidence (Level 2 or Level 3), making **St. John's wort** the most appropriate first-line CAM option to present for a patient with a major depressive episode of mild severity.

## Query 7
My patient is presenting with a mild severity major depressive episode. All other things being equal and accessible, what does CANMAT recommend for treatment?

### Answer
Psychotherapy because of fewer side effects, although psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy are equally effective

## Response
* **Treatment Recommendations for Mild Severity Major Depressive Episode:**
    + Unfortunately, the provided Clinical Guidelines Context does not explicitly mention the specific treatment recommendations for a mild severity major depressive episode.
    + However, it does mention that the CANMAT 2023 updated guidelines provide evidence-informed recommendations for the management of MDD in adults, emphasizing a collaborative, personalized, and systematic management approach.
* **Reference:** [CANMAT Guidelines](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#sec1)
* **Inference:** While the exact treatment recommendations are not provided, it can be inferred that the treatment approach may involve a personalized and systematic management plan, potentially including **medications** such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or other evidence-based treatments.
* **Note:** The provided context does not mention specific **medications**, but it is reasonable to assume that the treatment plan may involve **medications** such as **SSRIs**, **SNRIs**, or other commonly used treatments for major depressive disorder.
* **Important Note:** No clear recommendation found in the clinical guideline for mild severity major depressive episode. For accurate treatment recommendations, please refer to the full CANMAT 2023 guidelines.

## Query 8
My patient's depression has not responded to the medication dose I started them on a four weeks ago.  What should I do next?

### Answer
Optimize the dose

## Response
### Next Steps for Patient with Depression Not Responding to Initial Medication

Given that the patient's depression has not responded to the initial medication dose after four weeks, the following steps are recommended based on the clinical guidelines:

* **Optimize Dose**: If the patient is not on the maximum therapeutic dose, consider increasing the dose of the current antidepressant, balancing efficacy with potential side effects and adherence issues.
* **Assess Interfering Factors**: Evaluate factors that could interfere with treatment response, including psychiatric and nonpsychiatric comorbidities, adherence to treatment, biological and psychological factors, and pharmacokinetic factors (considering pharmacogenetic testing).

### Medication Considerations

If optimizing the dose is not effective or feasible:
- **Switch to Another Antidepressant**: Especially if there are intolerance issues with the initial antidepressant. Consider an antidepressant with a distinct mechanism of action or one with evidence of superior efficacy.
- **Add an Adjunctive Medication**: If there is a partial response to the initial antidepressant and it is well-tolerated. First-line options include **Aripiprazole**, **Brexpiprazole**, **Bupropion**, and **N-e-sketamine/lv**.

### Reference
- **Reference:** [Clinical Guidelines for Treating Depression](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#section9C-07067437241245384)
- The algorithm for sequential treatment after a suboptimal response to initial antidepressant medication provides a structured approach to managing treatment-resistant depression, including optimizing dose, considering psychological treatments, switching or adding medications, and neuromodulation treatments for difficult-to-treat cases.

## Query 9
My patient's depression has not responded to the SSRI medication I started them on, even after I optimized and increased the dose up to where they could still tolerate the side effects. I haven't tried anything else yet. What should I do now?

### Answer
If available, consider referral to psychotherapy for CBT, IPT, or behavioural activation

## Response
### Recommendations for Next Steps in Treatment

Given that the patient's depression has not responded to the **SSRI** medication, the following options are recommended:

* **Switch to Another Antidepressant**: Consider an antidepressant with a mechanism of action that is distinct from the previous one, such as **bupropion** or **mittazapine**. This option is especially considered if there are intolerance issues with the initial antidepressant.
* **Add an Adjunctive Medication**: If there is a partial response to the initial antidepressant and it is well tolerated, consider adding an adjunctive medication such as **aripiprazole**, **brexpiprazole**, or **bupropion**.

### Rationale

The evidence for switching antidepressants is inconsistent, but it may be considered if there are intolerance issues with the initial antidepressant. Adding an adjunctive medication may be a better option if there is a partial response to the initial antidepressant.

### Reference

- **Reference:** [Clinical Guidelines for Treatment-Resistant Depression](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#section9C-07067437241245384)
- **Reference:** [Algorithm for Sequential Treatment](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#fig2-07067437241245384)

### Important Considerations

* Assess factors that can interfere with treatment response, such as psychiatric and nonpsychiatric comorbidities, adherence to treatment, and pharmacokinetic factors.
* Consider psychotherapy earlier rather than later in treatment.
* Evaluate the advantages and drawbacks of each strategy, including switching to another antidepressant or adding an adjunctive medication.

## Query 10
My patient's depression has not responded to the SSRI medication I started them on, even after I optimized and increased the dose up to where they could still tolerate the side effects. They are not interested in psychotherapy. What should I do now?

### Answer
Since there is tolerability issues and no response, consider switching to an antidepressant of a different class such as an SNRI

## Response
### Recommendations for Next Steps in Treatment

Given that the patient's depression has not responded to the **SSRI** medication and they are not interested in psychotherapy, the following options can be considered:

* **Switch to Another Antidepressant**: Especially if there are intolerance issues with the initial antidepressant. Consider an antidepressant with a mechanism of action that is distinct from the previous one, such as:
	+ **Bupropion**
	+ **Mirtazapine**
	+ Other antidepressants with evidence of superior efficacy
* **Add an Adjunctive Medication**: Especially if there is a partial response to the initial antidepressant and it is well tolerated. Consider:
	+ **Aripiprazole**
	+ **Brexpiprazole**
	+ Other adjunctive medications such as **lithium**, **quetiapine-XL**, or **risperidone**

### Rationale

The patient has already optimized the dose of their initial **SSRI** medication, and increasing the dose further may not be effective and may increase side effects. Switching to another antidepressant or adding an adjunctive medication are the next steps in the treatment algorithm.

### Reference

## Query 11
My patient's depression achieved a partial response to the SSRI medication I started them on, but the improvements have been less than hoped. They are not experiencing any side effects from the SSRI. What should I do?

### Answer
Start them on adjunctive aripiprazole or brexpiprazole

## Response
### Recommendations for Patient with Partial Response to SSRI:

* **Optimizing the antidepressant dose** is an important first step when a patient has a partial response to an initial antidepressant treatment, such as **SSRI**. Increasing the dose to a higher than minimal therapeutic dose (up to the equivalent of 50 mg of **fluoxetine**) may be more effective, but it's crucial to balance this against potential increased side effects and poorer adherence.
* If optimizing the dose is not effective, the next steps could involve either switching to another antidepressant or adding an adjunctive medication. However, evidence suggests that switching antidepressants may not be superior to continuing the current one, and response rates may diminish with subsequent switches.

### Reference:
- **Reference:** [Clinical Guidelines for Antidepressant Treatment](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#section9C-07067437241245384)
- The decision to switch or add medication should be based on the patient's response to the initial treatment, considering factors like early improvement (or lack thereof) within the first 4 weeks, and tolerability concerns.

### Considerations:
- Early improvement (20% or greater reduction in symptom scores within the first 4 weeks) is a predictor of later response. If this is not observed, the likelihood of response or remission at 8 to 12 weeks is low, suggesting a need to reassess the treatment strategy.
- The **CANMAT (Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments) Criteria for Level of Evidence** provide a framework for evaluating the strength of evidence supporting different treatment approaches, ranging from Level 1 (high-quality meta-analysis) to Level 4 (expert opinion/consensus). 

### Medication Options:
- Continuing or increasing the dose of the current **SSRI**, if tolerated and within therapeutic guidelines.
- Switching to another antidepressant, considering the patient's specific response and side effect profile.
- Adding an adjunctive medication to the current **SSRI**, which may offer additional therapeutic benefits or help manage specific symptoms.

### Important Note:
The approach should be individualized, taking into account the patient's specific circumstances, including the presence of any side effects, the degree of response to the initial treatment, and other relevant clinical factors.

## Query 12
My patient's severe major depressive episode did not respond to an SSRI, and did not respond to SNRI after switching to it. I tried adding adjunctive pharmacotherapy as well but it did not work. What should I do now?

### Answer
ECT

## Response
### Recommendations for Treatment-Resistant Depression

Given that the patient's severe major depressive episode did not respond to an **SSRI** (Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor) and did not respond to an **SNRI** (Serotonin-Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitor) after switching, and adjunctive pharmacotherapy was also ineffective, the next steps should be considered based on the provided clinical guidelines context.

*   **Assess Interfering Factors**: Before proceeding with new treatments, it's crucial to assess factors that could interfere with treatment response, including psychiatric and nonpsychiatric comorbidities, adherence to treatment, other biological and psychological factors, and pharmacokinetic factors (considering pharmacogenetic testing).
*   **Optimize Dose**: If not already done, optimizing the dose of the current medication, considering another therapeutic dose or partial response to well-tolerated lower doses within the therapeutic range, might be beneficial.
*   **Consider Psychological Treatments**: Psychotherapy should be considered earlier rather than later in treatment. It can be an effective adjunct or alternative to pharmacotherapy.
*   **Switch or Adjunctive Medication**:
    *   **Switch to Another Antidepressant**: Especially if there are intolerance issues with the initial antidepressant. Consider an antidepressant with a mechanism of action distinct from the previous one or one with evidence of superior efficacy.
    *   **Add an Adjunctive Medication**: If there's a partial response to the initial antidepressant and it's well-tolerated. First-line options include **Aripiprazole**, **Brexpiprazole**, **Bupropion**, **N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists like Ketamine**, among others.
*   **Consider Neuromodulation Treatments for TRD (Treatment-Resistant Depression)**: These are generally considered after one of the switch or adjunctive medication options has failed. First-line options include **Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT)** for severe major depressive episodes and **Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS)** for treatment-resistant depression.

### Preferred Options

Given the patient's history of non-response to **SSRI** and **SNRI**, and the failure of adjunctive pharmacotherapy, the preferred next steps would involve either switching to a different class of antidepressants with a distinct mechanism of action or considering neuromodulation treatments, especially if the patient

## Query 13
I am about to start my patient on an antidepressant, but I am worried about their likelihood to adhere to medications, and they have abruptly stopped in the past. What medications have the highest risk of antidepressant discontinuation syndrome?

### Answer
Paroxetine and Venlafaxine

## Response
* **Medications with the highest risk of antidepressant discontinuation syndrome:**
  + **Paroxetine**: associated with a high risk of discontinuation symptoms due to its shorter half-life.
  + **Venlafaxine**: also associated with a high risk of discontinuation symptoms due to its shorter half-life.
* **Reason for high risk:** Antidepressants with a shorter half-life, such as **Paroxetine** and **Venlafaxine**, are associated with a greater incidence/severity and a quicker onset of discontinuation symptoms.
* **Reference:** [Reference 1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#section8-07067437241245384) and [Reference 2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#section8D-07067437241245384)

## Query 14
I am about to start my patient on an antidepressant, but I am worried about their likelihood to adhere to medications, and they have abruptly stopped in the past. What medications available in Canada have the lowest risk of antidepressant discontinuation syndrome?

### Answer
Bupropion, fluoxetine, mirtazapine, vortioxetine

## Response
* **Medications with Low Risk of Discontinuation Syndrome:**
  + The following medications have a low or minimal risk of antidepressant discontinuation syndrome:
    - **Agomelatine**
    - **Bupropion**
    - **Fluoxetine**
    - **Mirtazapine**
  + These medications are preferred due to their lower risk of discontinuation symptoms, which can be beneficial for patients who have a history of abruptly stopping their medication.
* **Reference:** [Clinical Guidelines Context](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#section8-07067437241245384)
* **Tapering Schedule:**
  + The Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) recommends a gradual tapering schedule over several weeks or months, unless there are clinical reasons requiring rapid discontinuation.
  + **Fluoxetine** does not require tapering due to its long half-life.
* **Reference:** [Clinical Guidelines Context](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#section8D-07067437241245384)
* **Monitoring Discontinuation Symptoms:**
  + Patients should be monitored using a validated measure, such as the Discontinuation-Emergent Signs and Symptoms (DESS) Scale, during antidepressant tapering.

## Query 15
My patient who I have been treating on antidepressant medication is no longer feeling any of their depressive symptoms. How long should they be on maintenance treatment for?

### Answer
A minimum of 6 to 12 months

## Response
* **Maintenance Treatment Duration**: The 2016 CANMAT guidelines recommend that patients maintain treatment with **antidepressants** for 6 to 12 months after achieving symptomatic remission. 
* **Reason for Recommendation**: New meta-regression evidence suggests that extending maintenance treatment for 6 to 12 months after remission adds benefit compared to stopping before 6 months (Level 1).
* **Reference:** [Reference 1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#section8B-07067437241245384)
* **Special Considerations**: 
  * Patients with risk factors for recurrence should continue **antidepressant** treatment for 2 years or more.
  * Patients with recurrent and severe MDEs should use sequential treatment (adding psychotherapy after stabilizing on medications) to prevent recurrence.
  * When a decision is made to stop the **antidepressant**, it should be tapered gradually, whenever possible, for several weeks or months with more time between dose reductions near the end of the taper.
* **Reference:** [Reference 2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#table1-07067437241245384)

## Query 16
My patient has had recurrent depressive episodes, and has now once again had their symptoms relieved by the medications I've prescribed. They want longer-lasting benefits and want help with preventing recurrent episodes in the future. What should can I offer them?

### Answer
Suggest adding psychotherapy such as CBT to be sequentially added once the acute phase of depression is over.

## Response
To prevent recurrent depressive episodes in your patient, you can offer the following options:
* **Maintenance pharmacotherapy**: Continue **antidepressant** medication treatment for a minimum of 6 to 12 months after achieving symptomatic remission. This can reduce relapse rates by 50% compared to placebo.
* **Psychotherapy**: Use maintenance psychotherapy, such as Cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT), in addition to pharmacotherapy to prevent recurrence. Sequential treatment, adding psychotherapy after stabilizing on **medications**, can be effective for patients with recurrent and severe major depressive episodes (MDEs).

These options are supported by Level 1 evidence, indicating high-quality meta-analysis with narrow confidence intervals and/or 2 or more RCTs with adequate sample size.

- **Reference:** [https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#section8B-07067437241245384](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#section8B-07067437241245384)

## Query 17
I am about to start my patient on citalopram. Is there any monitoring or investigations I should order for them based on the guidelines?

### Answer
ECG to check for QTc

## Response
### Monitoring and Investigations for Patients Starting **Citalopram**

When starting a patient on **citalopram**, it's essential to consider the necessary monitoring and investigations based on the clinical guidelines. 

* Routine laboratory tests are not necessary for monitoring antidepressant treatment for Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) unless in specific clinical situations.
* For patients with pre-existing liver diseases, liver function tests should be done at baseline and every 6 to 12 months.
* Serum electrolyte monitoring should be considered for older patients (age 60 years and older) due to the risk of hyponatremia with antidepressants.
* Regular monitoring of weight, glucose, and lipid profiles is recommended in patients taking medications associated with weight gain.

### Key Recommendations

* **Liver function tests**: Baseline and every 6 to 12 months for patients with pre-existing liver diseases.
* **Serum electrolyte monitoring**: Consider for older patients (age 60 years and older).
* **Weight, glucose, and lipid profiles**: Monitor at baseline and every 6 months when prescribing medications associated with weight gain.

## Query 18
My patient with a moderate severity major depressive episode would like to start a first-line SSRI, but wants to minimize their chances of sexual side effects. What is the best option for them?

### Answer
Sertraline

## Response
* To minimize the chances of sexual side effects in a patient with a moderate severity major depressive episode who wants to start a first-line **SSRI**, the best options are:
  * **Bupropion**: Although not an **SSRI**, it is a first-line treatment with a more favorable profile regarding sexual dysfunction.
  * **Vilazodone**: An **SSRI** with a more favorable profile regarding sexual dysfunction.
* These options are preferred because they have a lower rate of sexual side effects compared to other antidepressants, as shown in Table 3.5.
* **Reference:** [https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#section5E-07067437241245384](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#section5E-07067437241245384) and [https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#table14-07067437241245384](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#table14-07067437241245384)

## Query 19
My patient with a moderate severity major depressive episode would like to start a first-line SNRI, but wants to minimize their chances of sexual side effects. What is the best option for them?

### Answer
Desvenlafaxine

## Response
* To minimize the chances of sexual side effects when starting a first-line SNRI for a patient with a moderate severity major depressive episode, we need to consider the properties of different SNRIs.
* Unfortunately, the provided Clinical Guidelines Context does not explicitly discuss the sexual side effects of SNRIs or provide a direct comparison of these medications in terms of their side effect profiles.
* However, we can infer that since **St. John's wort** is mentioned as a treatment option with a **Level 2** evidence for moderate severity MDE, and it has a different mechanism of action compared to SNRIs, it might have a different side effect profile. 
* But, **St. John's wort** is not an SNRI, and combining it with serotonergic medications (e.g., **SSRIs** and **SNRIs**) is cautioned due to the uncertain risk of serotonin syndrome.
* Given the lack of explicit information on SNRIs and their sexual side effects in the provided context, we cannot recommend a specific SNRI based on the guidelines.
* **Reference:** [Clinical Guidelines Context](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#section5A-07067437241245384) does not provide sufficient information to answer this question.
* Therefore, the best approach would be to consult other clinical guidelines or resources that specifically address the side effect profiles of different SNRIs, such as the [Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) guidelines](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/).
* No clear recommendation found in the clinical guideline for the best SNRI option to minimize sexual side effects.

## Query 20
My patient with a moderate severity major depressive episode has tried an SSRI, without good effect, and now wants to try an SNRI. Their top priority is efficacy, and they are not concerned about any specific side effects. What's the best option for them?

### Answer
Venlafaxine-XR

## Response
### Recommended SNRI Options for Moderate Severity Major Depressive Episode

Given the patient's priority on efficacy and lack of concern for specific side effects, the top **SNRI** options can be considered based on their efficacy profiles. 

*   **Venlafaxine-XR**: This is a preferred option due to its more favorable efficacy profile compared to other **SNRIs**. 
*   **Duloxetine**: Although it has a less favorable profile in terms of sexual dysfunction, it still presents a viable alternative, especially considering its more favorable sedation profile.

### Reference
- **Reference:** [Clinical Guidelines for Selecting Pharmacological Treatments](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#section5E-07067437241245384)
- **Reference:** [Table 3.5 for Comparative Favourability Ratings of Antidepressants](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#table14-07067437241245384)

These recommendations are based on the comparative favourability ratings of antidepressants, including **SNRIs**, as outlined in Table 3.5 of the clinical guidelines. The choice between **Venlafaxine-XR** and **Duloxetine** should consider the patient's individual needs and potential side effects, despite the patient's stated lack of concern for side effects. 

### Important Considerations

- The patient has already tried an **SSRI** without a good effect, which is a common first-line treatment.
- **St. John's Wort**, a herbal compound, is recommended as a second-line treatment for moderate severity major depressive episodes but comes with caution due to potential drug interactions, especially with serotonergic medications like **SNRIs**.
- The efficacy of **SNRIs** can vary, and factors such as drug interactions, sedation, weight gain, sexual dysfunction, and other tolerability issues should be considered, even if the patient is not concerned about side effects.

### Final Recommendation

Given the information and the patient's priorities, **Venlafaxine-XR** appears to be the most appropriate **SNRI** option due to its favorable efficacy profile. However, it's crucial to monitor the patient's response and adjust the treatment plan as necessary, considering potential side effects and interactions.

## Query 27
Should a patient on an antidepressant also see a therapist?

### Answer
Yes, when possible, combining psychological treatments with pharmacotherapy is more effective than either alone for acute treatment, and reduces the risk of recurrence.

## Response
* **Recommendation:** Yes, a patient on an **antidepressant** should also consider seeing a therapist, as combining psychological treatment with pharmacotherapy is more effective than either alone for acute treatment.
* **Preferred Treatment Options:**
  + **Cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT)**: This is recommended as a second-line adjunctive treatment, with medications, for difficult-to-treat depression.
  + **Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT)**: This is also supported by strong evidence as an effective treatment when initiated sequentially after treatment with an **antidepressant** is established.
* **Rationale:** The strongest evidence supports in-person CBT (including MBCT) initiated sequentially after treatment with an **antidepressant** is established. Adding psychological treatment is effective whether the **antidepressant** is continued or not, but the highest chances of sustained recovery are seen when an **antidepressant** is continued with added psychological treatment.

## Query 28
I have a patient who often struggles with constipation Would paroxetine be  a good antidepressant to try first?

### Answer
While paroxetine is a first-line antidepressant, its risk of constipation is somewhat high, around 14%.  First line agents with less change of constipation include  escitalopram, sertraline, desvenlafaxine, vortioxetine, vilazodone and bupropion.

## Response
* **Medication Recommendation:** 
    * Considering the patient's struggle with constipation, **Escitalopram** or **Sertraline** might be a better option as they have a lower frequency of constipation (4% and 8% respectively) compared to **Paroxetine** (14%).
    * **Paroxetine** is not the most ideal choice for a patient with constipation issues due to its higher frequency of constipation as a side effect.
* **Reference:** [Table 3.4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#table13-07067437241245384) provides a comprehensive overview of the side effects of various medications, including their therapeutic doses and the minimum dose required to elicit these effects.
* **Treatment Considerations:**
    * The choice of the first antidepressant should be based on the balance of efficacy and tolerability, as stated in [section 3.e](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#section5E-07067437241245384).
    * Increasing the dose for nonresponse must be balanced against increasing side effect burden and poorer adherence, as mentioned in [section 7.c](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#section9C-07067437241245384).
* **Patient-Specific Factors:**
    * The patient's constipation issues should be taken into consideration when selecting an antidepressant medication.
    * The frequency of side effects, such as constipation, should be evaluated when choosing a medication, as presented in [Table 3.4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#table13-07067437241245384).

## Query 29
My patient wants to use an AI app for thier depression, is this safe?

### Answer
This application is currently using the 2023 update of the CANMAT guidelines, published in 2024. At the time of its publication, digital health applications for direct-use by pateints had limited evidence. Applications should be assede for whether their techniques are evidence-based and evaluated on real-world populations. Other important factors include the privacy and security of the tool, the potential for providing harmful or inaccurate advice, and whether the patient may experience any barriers

## Response
* The use of AI apps for depression is still at an early stage, and there is **insufficient evidence** to recommend them as a treatment for Major Depressive Disorder (MDD).
* According to the Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT), self-directed Digital Health Interventions (DHIs) may be used as **second-line adjunctive tools** to usual clinical care when clinicians provide support and guidance, but only for mild-moderate severity MDE (Major Depressive Episode).
* **Chatbots and conversational agents** are not recommended due to the lack of evidence and potential risks, such as inappropriate responses.
* Clinicians should **carefully evaluate** the risks and benefits of DHIs prior to clinical application and consider factors such as access, cost, and ease of use.
* **Guided iCBT DHIs** are recommended as **first-line treatment** for mild-moderate severity MDE, with a **Level 1** evidence rating.
* **Self-directed DHIs** may be considered as **third-line treatment** for mild severity MDE when no other clinical interventions are available, with a **Level 3** evidence rating.
* **Reference:** [Clinical Guidelines Context](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#section6E-07067437241245384) 
* **Reference:** [Table 4.3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#table19-07067437241245384) 
* No **medications** are recommended in the provided context for the use of AI apps or DHIs.

## Query 30
How do I know if an antidepressant is working?

### Answer
The guidelines recommend the use of measurement-based care, which involves the routine use of validated outcome scales which are reviewed the pateints, and are used alongside clinical assesement to support collaborative decision-making. Examples of validated scales include patient-rated scales like the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), and clinican-rated scalces such as the Hamilton DEpression Rating Scale (HAM-D).

## Response
To determine if an **antidepressant** is working, it's essential to monitor the patient's symptoms and response to treatment. Here are some key points to consider:

* Early improvement, defined as a 20% or greater reduction in scores on a symptom rating scale within the first 4 weeks after starting an **antidepressant**, predicts a later response.
* If early improvement is not seen by 4 weeks, there is only a low likelihood of response or remission at 8 to 12 weeks.
* At that point, the decision should be to either increase the dose or to switch the **antidepressant** if there are tolerability concerns.

Some commonly used **antidepressants** include:
* **SSRIs** (Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) such as **Citalopram**, **Escitalopram**, **Fluoxetine**, **Paroxetine**, and **Sertraline**
* **SNRIs** (Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors) such as **Desvenlafaxine**, **Duloxetine**, **Levomilnacipran**, and **Venlafaxine-XR**
* Other **antidepressants** like **Bupropion**, **Mirtazapine**, **Vilazodone**, and **Vortioxetine**

It's crucial to note that the choice of **antidepressant** depends on various factors, including the patient's medical history, tolerability, and potential drug interactions.

## Query 31
When a patient is better, how long should they continue their antidepressant for?

### Answer
We recommend that antidepressents be maintained for 6 to 12 months after a patient achieves remission unless a patient has risk factors for the recurrence of depressive factors, in which case treatment should be continued for 2 years or more. These risk factors include residual symptoms, chronic depressive episodes, medical comorbidities, greater number of previous episodes, poor social support, or persistent stressful life events.

## Response
* The duration for which a patient should continue their **antidepressant** medication after they are better depends on several factors, including their risk of recurrence and the severity of their condition.
* For patients who have achieved symptom remission, the general recommendation is to continue **antidepressant** treatment for a minimum of 6 to 12 months after achieving symptomatic remission, based on Level 1 evidence.
* For patients with risk factors for recurrence, **antidepressant** treatment should be continued for 2 years or more, based on Level 3 evidence.
* It's also important to note that when a decision is made to stop the **antidepressant**, it should be tapered gradually, whenever possible, for several weeks or months, based on Level 3 evidence.
* **Reference:** [Clinical Guidelines](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#section8B-07067437241245384) and [Table 6.1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#table1-07067437241245384) provide the basis for these recommendations.

## Query 32
My patient has not responded to escitalopram at 10 mg, what should I do next?

### Answer
Assuming the dose is well tolerated, a first step could be to optimize the escitalopram dose to 20 mg.

## Response
### Next Steps for Patient Not Responding to **Escitalopram** at 10 mg

* **Optimize Dose**: Consider increasing the dose of **escitalopram** if it is well-tolerated, as higher doses within the therapeutic range may be more effective. However, balance this against potential increased side effects and poorer adherence.
* **Assess Interfering Factors**: Evaluate psychiatric and nonpsychiatric comorbidities, adherence to treatment, and other biological and psychological factors that may interfere with response. Consider pharmacogenetic testing for pharmacokinetic factors.
* **Consider Adding Psychological Treatments**: Think about adding psychotherapy earlier rather than later in treatment, as it can be beneficial alongside medication.

### Medication Options

* **Switch to Another Antidepressant**: If there are intolerance issues with **escitalopram** or if a distinct mechanism of action is desired, consider switching to another antidepressant. 
    + **First Line**: Consider an antidepressant with a different mechanism of action or one with evidence of superior efficacy.
    + Examples might include **bupropion**, **venlafaxine**, or other antidepressants not in the same class as **escitalopram**.
* **Add an Adjunctive Medication**: If there is a partial response to **escitalopram** and it is well-tolerated, consider adding another medication.
    + **First Line**: Options include **aripiprazole**, **brexpiprazole**, **bupropion**, or other adjunctive medications like **lithium** or **quetiapine-XL**.

## Query 33
I am considering referring my patient to ECT for their depression. Would I need to stop their medications?

### Answer
Antidepressants and other medications can usually be continued during ECT treatment. A meta-analysis found that concurrent use of antidepressants during a course of ECT improved outcomes, but this was low-quality evidence based on older trials. Some concomitant medications may interfere with ECT efficacy (e.g., benzodiazepines and anticonvulsant medications) or worsen cognitive side effects (lithium and cannabis), and should be discontinued or held before ECT.

## Response
* **Medication Considerations for ECT:** 
  + Generally, **antidepressants** and other medications can be continued during ECT treatment (Level 2).
  + However, some concomitant medications may interfere with ECT efficacy or worsen cognitive side effects, and should be discontinued or held before ECT, such as:
    - **Benzodiazepines**
    - **Anticonvulsant medications**
    - **Lithium** (may worsen cognitive side effects)
    - **Cannabis** (may worsen cognitive side effects)
* **Reference:** [Clinical Guidelines for ECT](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#section10B1-07067437241245384)
* It's essential to weigh the benefits and risks of continuing or discontinuing medications during ECT treatment, considering individual patient factors and the potential impact on treatment outcomes.
