Question 2. What are the Principles for Depression Management? > Q.2.f. What Lifestyle Interventions are Effective? > paragraph id: 64

Exposure to natural light is important for maintaining circadian rhythmicity. Light therapy is a chronobiological intervention in which a device delivers timed exposure to supplemental bright light. A typical protocol for light therapy uses 10,000 lux fluorescent white light for 30 min daily in the morning, shortly after awakening. Light therapy continues to be recommended as first-line monotherapy for seasonal (winter) depression (seasonal pattern course specifier in DSM-5-TR) with several consistent supportive meta-analyses (Level 1) . Despite some heterogeneity, recent meta-analyses also find efficacy for light therapy in nonseasonal MDD (Major depressive disorder) (Level 2) , with larger effects when light therapy is combined with antidepressants. This evidence places bright light therapy as a second-line treatment for mild severity nonseasonal MDD (Major depressive disorder) and as adjunctive treatment with medications for moderate severity nonseasonal MDD (Major depressive disorder) ( Table 2.4 and Table 3.7 ).

Question 2. What are the Principles for Depression Management? > Q.2.f. What Lifestyle Interventions are Effective? > paragraph id: 61

The CANMAT (Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments) 2016 guidelines noted substantial evidence for the efficacy of exercise as a treatment for MDD (Major depressive disorder) (Level 2) . While recognizing heterogeneity in RCT (Randomized controlled trial) methods, recent meta-analyses continue to show that adjunctive exercise is superior to no treatment and treatment as usual conditions in MDD (Major depressive disorder), with medium to large effects (Level 1) . Exercise can also reduce suicidal ideation and has good effects when combined with antidepressants. Meta-analyses show benefits in reducing depressive symptoms with the supervised aerobic activity of moderate to high intensity in adolescents and young adults, with low to moderate intensity exercise in midlife and older women, and with high-intensity interval training in adults. Exercise also provides positive health benefits beyond its effects on depression. Taken together, these findings continue to support the use of supervised exercise (i.e., low to moderate intensity, for 30 to 40 min at a time, 3 to 4 times a week, for a minimum of 9 weeks) as a first-line monotherapy for mild depression and a second-line adjunctive treatment for moderate severity illness (Level 1) (Table 2.4 and Table 3.7).

Question 3. How are Treatments Selected? > Q.3.e. How is a Pharmacological Treatment Selected? > paragraph id: 84

When starting pharmacotherapy for MDD (Major depressive disorder), the prescriber has a choice of 31 antidepressants, including 17 that are considered first-line treatments because of robust evidence supporting their safety and efficacy in placebo-controlled RCTs (Level 1) ( Table 3.3 ). A network meta-analysis of placebo-controlled and active comparator trials confirmed that each of these antidepressants was more effective than placebo (Cipriani et al. 2018, in the Key References). The first choice of an antidepressant can be any of the first-line antidepressants, taking into account efficacy, potential for adverse effects, clinical presentation, cost, and patient preference. Clinicians should use psychoeducation when prescribing medications, including discussing risks and benefits, the time course of effect, and dispelling myths and misbeliefs about medication use.

Figure 7.1. Algorithm for sequential treatment after suboptimal response to initial antidepressant medication.

**Start**

Assess factors that can interfere with treatment response:
    - Psychiatric and nonpsychiatric comorbidities
    - Adherence to treatment
    - Other biological and psychological factors which may interfere with response
    - Pharmacokinetic factors (consider pharmacogenetic testing)

-> **Optimize Dose**
    If another therapeutic dose, or partial response to well-tolerated lower doses within the therapeutic range.

-> **Consider Adding Psychological Treatments**
    Consider psychotherapy earlier rather than later in treatment

-> **Switch or Adjunctive Medication**
    Consider advantages and drawbacks for each strategy.

    -> **Switch to Another Antidepressant**
        Especially if there are intolerance issues with the initial antidepressant.
        -> **First Line:**
            Consider an antidepressant with a mechanism of action that is distinct from previous one.
            Consider an antidepressant with evidence of superior efficacy (Table 3.5).
        -> **Second Line:**
            Consider a second- or third-line antidepressant.

    -> **Add an Adjunctive Medication**
        Especially if there is a partial response to initial antidepressant and it is well tolerated.
        -> **First Line:**
            Aripiprazole, brexpiprazole.
            - Bupropion, N e-sketamine/lv
            - Ketamine, cariprazine, lithium, mittazapine, modafinil, olanzapine, quetiapine-XL, risperidone, triiodothyronine.
        -> **Second Line:**
            Other antidepressants, stimulants, TCAs, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, lamotrigine, pramipexole, zprasidone.
        -> **Third Line:**
            Adjunctive transcranial direct current stimulation for MDD (Major depressive disorder)
            Vagus nerve stimulation for DTD (Difficult-to-treat depression)

-> **Consider Adding Neuromodulation Treatments for TRD (Treatment-resistant depression)**
    These are generally considered after one of the switch of adjunctive medication options.
    -> **First Line:**
        Electroconvulsive therapy for severe MDE (Major depressive episode)
        Transcranial magnetic stimulation for TRD (Treatment-resistant depression)
    -> **Second Line:**
        Electroconvulsive therapy for DTD (Difficult-to-treat depression)

**End**

Note. This algorithm refers primarily to medication treatments. Psychological treatments (see Table 3.2) should also be considered when patients have suboptimal responses to an initial medication. Neuromodulation treatments (see Table 8.3) are generally considered after a switch or adjunctive medication strategy has failed (i.e., for treatment-resistant depression). DTD (Difficult-to-treat depression) = difficult-to-treat depression; MDD (Major depressive disorder) = major depressive disorder; TCA (Tricyclic antidepressants) = tricyclic antidepressant; IN = intranasal; IV = intravenous; TRD (Treatment-resistant depression) = treatment-resistant depression; XR = extended release.

Question 3. How are Treatments Selected? > Q.3.a. How is the Initial Treatment Selected? > paragraph id: 74

In severe cases of MDE (Major depressive episode) with high safety risk and without psychotic features, CANMAT (Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments) recommends the combination of antidepressant medication and psychotherapy, either started at the same time or in a staggered fashion as planned sequential treatment (Level 2) (see Q.3.b). For severe MDE (Major depressive episode) with psychotic symptoms, the combination of an antidepressant and an atypical antipsychotic (serotonin-dopamine activity modulator) is recommended; structured psychotherapy should not be considered until psychotic symptoms subside (Level 1) . In the most severe MDEs and/or in life-threatening situations (e.g., severe suicide risk and physical deterioration), electroconvulsive therapy (ECT (Electroconvulsive therapy)) should be considered as the first-choice option (Level 3) .

Question 3. How are Treatments Selected? > Q.3.g. How do DSM-5-TR Specifiers and Symptom Dimensions Influence Medication Selection? > Box 3.1. > paragraph id: 103

Anhedonia as a Treatment Target.
There is significant clinical and research interest in anhedonia as a primary and persisting symptom of MDD (Major depressive disorder) (as well as other conditions) and specific treatment approaches. Anhedonia is reported by up to 70% of patients with MDD (Major depressive disorder) and its presence is associated with a reduced likelihood of remission with SSRI (Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) treatment, possibly because anhedonia may be an indicator of dopaminergic dysfunction. A meta-analysis suggests that monoaminergic antidepressants, ketamine, methylphenidate and psilocybin are associated, in varying degrees, with improvement in the severity of anhedonia. In contrast, escitalopram and riluzole were not as effective in improving anhedonia in MDD (Major depressive disorder). Several investigational medications are in early phase trials to target anhedonia as a primary outcome.

Question 3. How are Treatments Selected? > Q.3.g. How do DSM-5-TR Specifiers and Symptom Dimensions Influence Medication Selection? > paragraph id: 101

The 2016 CANMAT (Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments) guidelines also identified some symptom dimensions not included in DSM-5-TR that may have treatment specificity ( Table 3.6 ). Cognitive symptoms (problems with concentration, memory, and executive functioning) are common in MDD (Major depressive disorder) and medications such as vortioxetine, bupropion, and SNRIs may have superior efficacy for cognitive dysfunction compared to SSRIs (Level 2) . Recent meta-analyses support these findings. Duloxetine and other SNRIs show more benefits for comorbid pain conditions compared to SSRIs. Energy, fatigue, and motivation symptoms may preferentially respond to SNRIs compared to SSRIs (Level 2) .

Question 7. What Should be Done When a Patient is not Better? > Q.7.h. What Psychological Treatments are Effective After Poor Response to the Initial Antidepressant? > paragraph id: 211

There are few studies of psychotherapy for patients showing poor response to antidepressants. A Cochrane review of patients with poor response to an initial antidepressant found moderate-quality evidence supporting psychotherapy (primarily from 1 large trial of CBT (Cognitive-behavioural therapy)) added to usual care (including antidepressants) for reducing depressive symptoms and increasing response and remission rates (Level 2) . Hence, CBT (Cognitive-behavioural therapy) is recommended as a second-line adjunctive treatment, with medications, for DTD (Difficult-to-treat depression).

For MDE (Major depressive episode) with mild severity and low safety risk (see Q.2c), evidence-based psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy have similar efficacy, but the balance of benefits and risks suggests a first-line psychotherapy, if readily accessible, as the preferred treatment. At this lower level of severity, monotherapy treatment with exercise, CAM (Complementary and alternative medicine) (Q.3.m) treatments and guided DHIs (Q.4.d) may be considered, especially when preferred by patients. Note that there is stronger evidence for efficacy and safety of pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy, compared to these treatments.

Question 3. How are Treatments Selected? > Q.3.m. What Complementary and Alternative Medicine Treatments are Effective? > paragraph id: 119

CAM (Complementary and alternative medicine) treatments are increasingly used to manage depression. Here we provide recommendations for using the CAM (Complementary and alternative medicine) treatments that have the best quality evidence, focusing on new data since the CANMAT (Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments) 2016 guidelines (see Sarris et al., 2022, for practical guidance/dosage information). To date, no CAM (Complementary and alternative medicine) treatment has reached the level of evidence that would make it comparable to a first-line psychotherapy or pharmacotherapy treatment for moderate to severe depression. There is also inconsistency in the therapeutic dose ranges of most CAM (Complementary and alternative medicine) treatments. CANMAT (Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments) therefore recommends the consideration of CAM (Complementary and alternative medicine) treatments alone only for MDE (Major depressive episode) of mild severity (see Q.3.a), whereas CAM (Complementary and alternative medicine) treatments may be used as adjuncts to standard treatments in moderate severity illness.

Nutraceuticals are unregulated products which include substances derived from natural sources, including dietary supplements and food additives. L-methyl folate (folic acid) has meta-analytic evidence for efficacy in mild–moderate MDE (Major depressive episode), but the small effect sizes make it a second-line recommendation (Level 2) ( Table 3.7 ). S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM-e) was previously recommended as a second-line adjunctive treatment for mild to moderate MDE (Major depressive episode). Owing to mixed findings in recent RCTs, SAM-e is now downgraded to a third-line treatment (Level 2) . Similarly, omega-3 fatty acids were recommended previously as a second-line intervention for mild-severity episodes. A Cochrane review concluded there was insufficient high-quality evidence to evaluate its effects accurately, hence, omega-3 fatty acids are now downgraded to a third-line treatment (Level 2) . There is modest evidence for the benefit of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) for MDD (Major depressive disorder) in a recent meta-analysis, hence DHEA remains recommended as a third-line CAM (Complementary and alternative medicine) treatment.

In summary, owing to the variability of individual patient cases and limitations of the evidence base, few definitive or universally preferred treatments apply to all patients. Therefore, these CANMAT (Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments) recommendations should be viewed as guidance for clinicians to consider within the context of each patient, rather than as established standards of care. Finally, since the CANMAT (Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments) guidelines have a global reach and the evidence base is not country-specific, we note that some recommended treatments are not available in Canada and that regulatory requirements for medications vary from country to country.

Question 7. What Should be Done When a Patient is not Better? > Q.7.a. What Contributes to a Poor Response to Treatment? > paragraph id: 180

In real-world populations, approximately half of patients with MDD (Major depressive disorder) achieve response (>50% reduction in symptom severity) after 8 weeks of antidepressant monotherapy, while about a third attain full symptom remission; only a quarter of nonremitters who receive a second pharmacological treatment will reach remission. For first-treatment patients, the remission rates are higher, but almost half will not achieve remission with antidepressants after 6 months of treatment. Hence, inadequate response to treatment is a common clinical challenge.

    - Other biological and psychological factors which may interfere with response
    - Pharmacokinetic factors (consider pharmacogenetic testing)

-> **Optimize Dose**

-> **Consider Adding Psychological Treatments**
    Consider psychotherapy earlier rather than later in treatment

-> **Switch or Adjunctive Medication**
    Consider advantages and drawbacks for each strategy.

    -> **Switch to Another Antidepressant**

            Consider a second- or third-line antidepressant.

    -> **Add an Adjunctive Medication**
        Especially if there is a partial response to initial antidepressant and it is well tolerated.

        -> **Third Line:**
            Adjunctive transcranial direct current stimulation for MDD (Major depressive disorder)
            Vagus nerve stimulation for DTD (Difficult-to-treat depression)

-> **Consider Adding Neuromodulation Treatments for TRD (Treatment-resistant depression)**
    These are generally considered after one of the switch of adjunctive medication options.
    -> **First Line:**
        Electroconvulsive therapy for severe MDE (Major depressive episode)
        Transcranial magnetic stimulation for TRD (Treatment-resistant depression)
    -> **Second Line:**
        Electroconvulsive therapy for DTD (Difficult-to-treat depression)

**End**

Note. This algorithm refers primarily to medication treatments. Psychological treatments (see Table 3.2) should also be considered when patients have suboptimal responses to an initial medication. Neuromodulation treatments (see Table 8.3) are generally considered after a switch or adjunctive medication strategy has failed (i.e., for treatment-resistant depression). DTD (Difficult-to-treat depression) = difficult-to-treat depression; MDD (Major depressive disorder) = major depressive disorder; TCA (Tricyclic antidepressants) = tricyclic antidepressant; IN = intranasal; IV = intravenous; TRD (Treatment-resistant depression) = treatment-resistant depression; XR = extended release.

Optimizing the antidepressant dose is an important first step. Higher than minimal therapeutic doses are more effective (to a plateau around the equivalent of 50 mg of fluoxetine) but less well-tolerated (Level 1) . Hence, increasing the dose for nonresponse must be balanced against increasing side effect burden and poorer adherence.

Question 7. What Should be Done When a Patient is not Better? > Q.7.c. How are Strategies Sequenced When There is a Poor Response to an Initial Antidepressant Treatment? > paragraph id: 187

Optimizing the antidepressant dose is an important first step. Higher than minimal therapeutic doses are more effective (to a plateau around the equivalent of 50 mg of fluoxetine) but less well-tolerated (Level 1) . Hence, increasing the dose for nonresponse must be balanced against increasing side effect burden and poorer adherence.

Question 7. What Should be Done When a Patient is not Better? > Q.7.a. What Contributes to a Poor Response to Treatment? > paragraph id: 180

In real-world populations, approximately half of patients with MDD (Major depressive disorder) achieve response (>50% reduction in symptom severity) after 8 weeks of antidepressant monotherapy, while about a third attain full symptom remission; only a quarter of nonremitters who receive a second pharmacological treatment will reach remission. For first-treatment patients, the remission rates are higher, but almost half will not achieve remission with antidepressants after 6 months of treatment. Hence, inadequate response to treatment is a common clinical challenge.

## Query 10
My patient's depression has not responded to the SSRI medication I started them on, even after I optimized and increased the dose up to where they could still tolerate the side effects. They are not interested in psychotherapy. What should I do now?

### Answer
Since there is tolerability issues and no response, consider switching to an antidepressant of a different class such as an SNRI

For these medication strategies, a comprehensive review of previous medication trials, major side effects experienced, and whether there is a partial response, can inform the decision. Switching should be considered first when there is no response to the initial antidepressant or when the first medication has troublesome side effects. Adjunctive strategies should be considered first when there is a partial response to the initial antidepressant and there are minimal or no tolerability issues with the first medication.

Question 6. What Should be Done When a Patient is Better? > Q.6.d. How Should Antidepressant Treatment be Discontinued? > paragraph id: 175

Up to 50% of patients may experience discontinuation symptoms when stopping long-term use of antidepressants, especially with abrupt stopping. Discontinuation symptoms may include flu-like symptoms, insomnia, nausea, imbalance, sensory disturbances, and hyperarousal (the FINISH mnemonic). These emergent symptoms generally occur within a few days after a decrease in dose or stopping the antidepressant, are mild to moderate in severity, and resolve within a few weeks. However, later onset, greater severity, and longer duration of symptoms lasting several months or longer have been reported (see Box 6.1 ). Antidepressants with a shorter half-life, such as paroxetine and venlafaxine, are associated with a greater incidence/severity and a quicker onset of discontinuation symptoms. Table 6.3 shows the risk of discontinuation symptoms for various antidepressants.

Question 6. What Should be Done When a Patient is Better? > Q.6.d. How Should Antidepressant Treatment be Discontinued? > paragraph id: 177

It is important to differentiate discontinuation symptoms from early symptoms of recurrence since misdiagnosing these emergent symptoms can prolong antidepressant use unnecessarily. Discontinuation symptoms generally have an earlier onset (within days rather than weeks), are often characterized by somatic symptoms (e.g., nausea, dizziness, and shock-like sensations) that differ from those of the initial depressive episode, and improve rapidly if the dose is restored to its previous level. Although gradual tapering of antidepressants may not prevent discontinuation symptoms, they typically occur less frequently compared to abrupt stopping and are less severe. Psychological support may also help with antidepressant discontinuation. Adding psychotherapy may allow patients to stop medication without increasing the risk of relapse and may help mitigate discontinuation symptoms while tapering the antidepressant.

Question 6. What Should be Done When a Patient is Better? > Q.6.d. How Should Antidepressant Treatment be Discontinued? > Box 6.1. > paragraph id: 176

Protracted Discontinuation Symptoms and Hyperbolic Tapering Schedules.
Persistent discontinuation syndromes, with severe, potentially irreversible symptoms persisting beyond 6 weeks, have been described after stopping long-term antidepressant treatment. However, differing rates in the literature suggest that these discontinuation syndromes are heterogeneous, often occur with overlapping conditions, and require individual attention and assessment. In addition, since protracted discontinuation symptoms have mostly been reported in case reports, user surveys and internet forums, more rigorous studies are needed to establish their frequency, severity, and risk.
It has been suggested that, at the lower end of the therapeutic dose range, linear dose reduction may still result in a disproportionately large reduction in serotonin transporter inhibition, which may contribute to severe withdrawal symptoms. As a result, instead of decreasing the dose by a fixed amount (e.g., 10 mg), a “hyperbolic dose reduction” approach has been proposed, which targets a fixed percentage (e.g., 10%) reduction in serotonin receptor occupancy with each dose decrease. However, this approach is extrapolated from receptor studies using positron emission tomography (PET) in small numbers of participants and has not been evaluated in RCTs. The dosing schedule also presents a challenge in clinical practice, as it relies on compounding pharmacies to prepare liquid formulations or encapsulated nonstandard doses of antidepressants to achieve the required low doses. Hence, there is insufficient evidence to recommend hyperbolic tapering schedules.

Question 6. What Should be Done When a Patient is Better? > Q.6.d. How Should Antidepressant Treatment be Discontinued? > paragraph id: 179

Given the uncertainty about discontinuation strategies, CANMAT (Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments) recommends a pragmatic approach. Unless there are clinical reasons requiring rapid discontinuation (e.g., serious side effects, serotonin syndrome, etc.), antidepressants should be tapered gradually over several weeks or months (except for fluoxetine, which does not need tapering because of its long half-life), extending the time between dose reductions towards the end of the taper (Level 3) . In situations where antidepressants have been used for less than 4 weeks (e.g., a decision to stop the medication because of side effects), a fast-tapering schedule over 2 weeks or less can be used (Level 3) . Psychological treatments may also be used during or preceding antidepressant discontinuation, if available and acceptable to the patient, to reduce or mitigate discontinuation effects (Level 2) . If discontinuation symptoms are severe when the dose is decreased, patients can return to the previous higher dose, with a slower tapering schedule used subsequently. Alternatively, SSRI (Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) and SNRI (Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor) antidepressants can be switched to a long-acting medication such as fluoxetine, which can then be tapered. During antidepressant tapering, patients should be monitored using a validated measure such as the Discontinuation-Emergent Signs and Symptoms (DESS) Scale (Level 3) .

Question 6. What Should be Done When a Patient is Better? > Q.6.d. How Should Antidepressant Treatment be Discontinued? > paragraph id: 175

Up to 50% of patients may experience discontinuation symptoms when stopping long-term use of antidepressants, especially with abrupt stopping. Discontinuation symptoms may include flu-like symptoms, insomnia, nausea, imbalance, sensory disturbances, and hyperarousal (the FINISH mnemonic). These emergent symptoms generally occur within a few days after a decrease in dose or stopping the antidepressant, are mild to moderate in severity, and resolve within a few weeks. However, later onset, greater severity, and longer duration of symptoms lasting several months or longer have been reported (see Box 6.1 ). Antidepressants with a shorter half-life, such as paroxetine and venlafaxine, are associated with a greater incidence/severity and a quicker onset of discontinuation symptoms. Table 6.3 shows the risk of discontinuation symptoms for various antidepressants.

Question 6. What Should be Done When a Patient is Better? > Q.6.d. How Should Antidepressant Treatment be Discontinued? > Box 6.1. > paragraph id: 176

Protracted Discontinuation Symptoms and Hyperbolic Tapering Schedules.
Persistent discontinuation syndromes, with severe, potentially irreversible symptoms persisting beyond 6 weeks, have been described after stopping long-term antidepressant treatment. However, differing rates in the literature suggest that these discontinuation syndromes are heterogeneous, often occur with overlapping conditions, and require individual attention and assessment. In addition, since protracted discontinuation symptoms have mostly been reported in case reports, user surveys and internet forums, more rigorous studies are needed to establish their frequency, severity, and risk.
It has been suggested that, at the lower end of the therapeutic dose range, linear dose reduction may still result in a disproportionately large reduction in serotonin transporter inhibition, which may contribute to severe withdrawal symptoms. As a result, instead of decreasing the dose by a fixed amount (e.g., 10 mg), a “hyperbolic dose reduction” approach has been proposed, which targets a fixed percentage (e.g., 10%) reduction in serotonin receptor occupancy with each dose decrease. However, this approach is extrapolated from receptor studies using positron emission tomography (PET) in small numbers of participants and has not been evaluated in RCTs. The dosing schedule also presents a challenge in clinical practice, as it relies on compounding pharmacies to prepare liquid formulations or encapsulated nonstandard doses of antidepressants to achieve the required low doses. Hence, there is insufficient evidence to recommend hyperbolic tapering schedules.

Question 6. What Should be Done When a Patient is Better? > Q.6.b. How is Recurrence Prevented? > paragraph id: 170

The 2016 CANMAT (Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments) guidelines recommended that patients maintain treatment with antidepressants for 6 to 9 months after achieving symptomatic remission. New meta-regression evidence suggests that extending maintenance treatment for 6 to 12 months after remission adds benefit compared to stopping before 6 months (Level 1) . Hence, the recommendation has been adjusted to maintain antidepressants for 6 to 12 months after remission ( Table 6.1 ).

Question 6. What Should be Done When a Patient is Better? > Q.6.c. Who Needs Longer-Term Antidepressant Treatment? > paragraph id: 173

While 6 to 12 months of maintenance antidepressant treatment is recommended for all patients, some will require longer-term maintenance because they have risk factors for recurrence and chronicity ( Table 6.2 ). Most risk factors are longitudinal and part of a continuum of exposure to depression and other psychological stressors throughout the lifespan. A systematic meta-review identified residual symptoms and a history of maltreatment or abuse during childhood as robust risk factors for recurrence. Other risk factors, including longer episode duration and greater severity of depressive episodes, have less evidence to support a higher risk of recurrence. Some evidence suggests that prior depressive episodes and residual symptoms could indicate a kindling effect, in which subsequent depressive episodes are triggered by milder stressors, and whereby certain individual characteristics such as early childhood adversity and neuroticism may contribute to a heightened sensitivity to life stressors over time.

Question 6. What Should be Done When a Patient is Better? > Q.6.c. Who Needs Longer-Term Antidepressant Treatment? > paragraph id: 174

For patients with risk factors for recurrence, antidepressant treatment should be continued for 2 years or more (Level 3) ( Table 6.1 ). Support tools using machine learning algorithms have been developed to estimate the risk of recurrence based on an individual's risk profile, to assist clinicians and patients in making informed decisions about maintenance treatments. These risk-prediction models look promising, but further validation is required before they can be recommended for clinical use.

Question 6. What Should be Done When a Patient is Better? > Q.6.b. How is Recurrence Prevented? > paragraph id: 168

Once patients achieve symptom remission, maintenance pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy are both effective strategies for preventing a depressive recurrence ( Table 6.1 ). Maintenance medication treatment can reduce relapse rates by 50% compared to placebo, and flexible dose adjustments are more effective than fixed doses. In recent, large-sample RCTs examining maintaining or discontinuing antidepressants in stably treated patients, medication maintenance was associated with lower rates of recurrence during 1-year and 3-year follow-up, whether or not patients had CBT (Cognitive-behavioural therapy) during acute treatment (Level 1) .

**Start**

Assess factors that can interfere with treatment response:
    - Psychiatric and nonpsychiatric comorbidities
    - Adherence to treatment
    - Other biological and psychological factors which may interfere with response
    - Pharmacokinetic factors (consider pharmacogenetic testing)

-> **Optimize Dose**
    If another therapeutic dose, or partial response to well-tolerated lower doses within the therapeutic range.

-> **Consider Adding Psychological Treatments**
    Consider psychotherapy earlier rather than later in treatment

-> **Switch or Adjunctive Medication**
    Consider advantages and drawbacks for each strategy.

    -> **Switch to Another Antidepressant**
        Especially if there are intolerance issues with the initial antidepressant.

            Consider an antidepressant with a mechanism of action that is distinct from previous one.
            Consider an antidepressant with evidence of superior efficacy (Table 3.5).
        -> **Second Line:**
            Consider a second- or third-line antidepressant.

    -> **Add an Adjunctive Medication**
        Especially if there is a partial response to initial antidepressant and it is well tolerated.
        -> **First Line:**
            Aripiprazole, brexpiprazole.
            - Bupropion, N e-sketamine/lv
            - Ketamine, cariprazine, lithium, mittazapine, modafinil, olanzapine, quetiapine-XL, risperidone, triiodothyronine.
        -> **Second Line:**
            Other antidepressants, stimulants, TCAs, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, lamotrigine, pramipexole, zprasidone.
        -> **Third Line:**
            Adjunctive transcranial direct current stimulation for MDD (Major depressive disorder)
            Vagus nerve stimulation for DTD (Difficult-to-treat depression)

-> **Consider Adding Neuromodulation Treatments for TRD (Treatment-resistant depression)**
    These are generally considered after one of the switch of adjunctive medication options.
    -> **First Line:**
        Electroconvulsive therapy for severe MDE (Major depressive episode)
        Transcranial magnetic stimulation for TRD (Treatment-resistant depression)
    -> **Second Line:**
        Electroconvulsive therapy for DTD (Difficult-to-treat depression)

**End**

Note. This algorithm refers primarily to medication treatments. Psychological treatments (see Table 3.2) should also be considered when patients have suboptimal responses to an initial medication. Neuromodulation treatments (see Table 8.3) are generally considered after a switch or adjunctive medication strategy has failed (i.e., for treatment-resistant depression). DTD (Difficult-to-treat depression) = difficult-to-treat depression; MDD (Major depressive disorder) = major depressive disorder; TCA (Tricyclic antidepressants) = tricyclic antidepressant; IN = intranasal; IV = intravenous; TRD (Treatment-resistant depression) = treatment-resistant depression; XR = extended release.

Question 3. How are Treatments Selected? > Q.3.e. How is a Pharmacological Treatment Selected? > paragraph id: 91

Regarding efficacy, 8 antidepressant medications (bupropion, escitalopram, mirtazapine, paroxetine, sertraline, venlafaxine-XR, vortioxetine, and agomelatine) have evidence for superior response, although these are in the range of 5 to 10 percentage points difference versus comparator medications. Acceptability (all-cause discontinuation rates in meta-analyses) is also more favourable for several medications. For drug interactions (see Q.3.j), fluoxetine, fluvoxamine and paroxetine have clinically relevant potential interactions with other medications. Citalopram carries a risk of QTc prolongation; however, the clinical risk is low, and citalopram has been used safely in large trials of MDD (Major depressive disorder) with comorbid cardiovascular disease (note that escitalopram does not carry a clinically relevant higher risk of QTc prolongation). Most antidepressants have a risk of elevation of liver function tests (LFTs, see Q.3.j), but agomelatine includes the requirement for regular monitoring of LFTs in its product monograph.

Figure 7.1. Algorithm for sequential treatment after suboptimal response to initial antidepressant medication.

**Start**

Assess factors that can interfere with treatment response:
    - Psychiatric and nonpsychiatric comorbidities
    - Adherence to treatment
    - Other biological and psychological factors which may interfere with response
    - Pharmacokinetic factors (consider pharmacogenetic testing)

-> **Optimize Dose**
    If another therapeutic dose, or partial response to well-tolerated lower doses within the therapeutic range.

-> **Consider Adding Psychological Treatments**
    Consider psychotherapy earlier rather than later in treatment

-> **Switch or Adjunctive Medication**
    Consider advantages and drawbacks for each strategy.

    -> **Switch to Another Antidepressant**
        Especially if there are intolerance issues with the initial antidepressant.
        -> **First Line:**
            Consider an antidepressant with a mechanism of action that is distinct from previous one.
            Consider an antidepressant with evidence of superior efficacy (Table 3.5).
        -> **Second Line:**
            Consider a second- or third-line antidepressant.

    -> **Add an Adjunctive Medication**
        Especially if there is a partial response to initial antidepressant and it is well tolerated.
        -> **First Line:**
            Aripiprazole, brexpiprazole.
            - Bupropion, N e-sketamine/lv
            - Ketamine, cariprazine, lithium, mittazapine, modafinil, olanzapine, quetiapine-XL, risperidone, triiodothyronine.
        -> **Second Line:**
            Other antidepressants, stimulants, TCAs, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, lamotrigine, pramipexole, zprasidone.
        -> **Third Line:**
            Adjunctive transcranial direct current stimulation for MDD (Major depressive disorder)
            Vagus nerve stimulation for DTD (Difficult-to-treat depression)

-> **Consider Adding Neuromodulation Treatments for TRD (Treatment-resistant depression)**
    These are generally considered after one of the switch of adjunctive medication options.
    -> **First Line:**
        Electroconvulsive therapy for severe MDE (Major depressive episode)
        Transcranial magnetic stimulation for TRD (Treatment-resistant depression)
    -> **Second Line:**
        Electroconvulsive therapy for DTD (Difficult-to-treat depression)

**End**

Note. This algorithm refers primarily to medication treatments. Psychological treatments (see Table 3.2) should also be considered when patients have suboptimal responses to an initial medication. Neuromodulation treatments (see Table 8.3) are generally considered after a switch or adjunctive medication strategy has failed (i.e., for treatment-resistant depression). DTD (Difficult-to-treat depression) = difficult-to-treat depression; MDD (Major depressive disorder) = major depressive disorder; TCA (Tricyclic antidepressants) = tricyclic antidepressant; IN = intranasal; IV = intravenous; TRD (Treatment-resistant depression) = treatment-resistant depression; XR = extended release.

Question 3. How are Treatments Selected? > Q.3.e. How is a Pharmacological Treatment Selected? > paragraph id: 92

Table 3.5 also summarizes comparative ratings for side effects of particular importance to patients (sedation, weight gain, and sexual dysfunction) alongside a category of other tolerability (side effects other than those 3). For sedation and weight gain, results from longer-term observational studies are included in the comparative assessment. Of note is that some treatment-emergent weight gain may be normative, e.g., in patients whose depressive symptoms include weight loss. Treatment-emergent sexual dysfunction, which can affect all phases of sexual response (desire, arousal, and orgasm) is also commonly experienced with antidepressants, particularly in those with serotonergic effects. Based on studies where sexual dysfunction is systematically assessed, several antidepressants (desvenlafaxine, bupropion, mirtazapine, vilazodone, vortioxetine, and agomelatine) are associated with lower rates of sexual side effects. Because sexual dysfunction can also be a symptom of depression, an assessment of baseline sexual functioning is important to identify emergent sexual side effects.

Question 7. What Should be Done When a Patient is not Better? > Q.7.c. How are Strategies Sequenced When There is a Poor Response to an Initial Antidepressant Treatment? > paragraph id: 187

Optimizing the antidepressant dose is an important first step. Higher than minimal therapeutic doses are more effective (to a plateau around the equivalent of 50 mg of fluoxetine) but less well-tolerated (Level 1) . Hence, increasing the dose for nonresponse must be balanced against increasing side effect burden and poorer adherence.

Question 7. What Should be Done When a Patient is not Better? > Q.7.c. How are Strategies Sequenced When There is a Poor Response to an Initial Antidepressant Treatment? > paragraph id: 185

Strategies for poor response to an initial antidepressant include optimizing the dose, switching to another antidepressant, adding an adjunctive medication, and incorporating psychological and/or neuromodulation treatments. Given the limited evidence, CANMAT (Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments) recommends that the sequencing of treatments should be based on a collaborative approach that integrates prior treatment history, the strength of the evidence for efficacy, potential for adverse events, and patient preference (Level 4) ( Figure 7.1 ). Based on efficacy and low potential for side effects, first-line psychological treatments should be considered early in the treatment course (Level 2) . Neuromodulation treatments, while having good evidence for efficacy in TRD (Treatment-resistant depression) and DTD (Difficult-to-treat depression), are less likely to be considered early in the treatment algorithm because of limited accessibility and patient burden (see Q.8.d).

Question 3. How are Treatments Selected? > Q.3.g. How do DSM-5-TR Specifiers and Symptom Dimensions Influence Medication Selection? > paragraph id: 101

The 2016 CANMAT (Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments) guidelines also identified some symptom dimensions not included in DSM-5-TR that may have treatment specificity ( Table 3.6 ). Cognitive symptoms (problems with concentration, memory, and executive functioning) are common in MDD (Major depressive disorder) and medications such as vortioxetine, bupropion, and SNRIs may have superior efficacy for cognitive dysfunction compared to SSRIs (Level 2) . Recent meta-analyses support these findings. Duloxetine and other SNRIs show more benefits for comorbid pain conditions compared to SSRIs. Energy, fatigue, and motivation symptoms may preferentially respond to SNRIs compared to SSRIs (Level 2) .

Question 7. What Should be Done When a Patient is not Better? > Q.7.c. How are Strategies Sequenced When There is a Poor Response to an Initial Antidepressant Treatment? > paragraph id: 188

After optimizing the dose, the main medication options involve switching to another antidepressant or adding an adjunctive medication. The evidence for the efficacy of switching antidepressants is inconsistent. Meta-analyses show that switching to another antidepressant is not superior to continuing the same one (Level 2) and there appears to be diminishing response rates for antidepressant monotherapy beyond the first switch.

Introduction > paragraph id: 10

The scope of these guidelines is the management of MDD (Major depressive disorder) in adults, with a target audience of community-based psychiatrists and mental health providers. CANMAT (Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments) previously published guidelines for bipolar disorder, in collaboration with the International Society for Bipolar Disorders (ISBD), and clinical guidelines for perinatal mood and anxiety-related disorders are in development; guidelines for other populations such as geriatric and pediatric depression are in planning. As done with previous versions, CANMAT (Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments) will produce briefer summaries of the guidelines for clinicians, such as the CANMAT (Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments) Pocket Guide to Depression. Additionally, the CHOICE-D Patient and Family Guide to Depression Treatment will be revised to reflect the content of the updated guidelines for patient and public knowledge dissemination.

Question 5. How is Treatment Monitored? > Q.5.c. How is Measurement-Based Care Implemented? > paragraph id: 162

While acknowledging these concerns, many of these perceived barriers can be addressed. Practical tips for incorporating MBC (Measurement-based care) in clinical settings include using simple PROMs that are free of charge, emailing scales to patients to complete prior to their appointment, and having patients complete scales in the waiting room before the appointment. Mobile and internet apps are also available that allow patients to complete validated scales and track their scores on their own time. For example, Apple has integrated the PHQ (Patient health questionnaire)-9 and GAD-7 into its Health mobile app, so that scores can be tracked alongside other health indicators.

Question 4. What is the Role of DHIs? > Q.4.b. What are Best Practices for Evaluating DHIs? > paragraph id: 138

Access, cost, and ease of use are also important aspects, particularly for users with disabilities or language/literacy issues. While up-front costs for many DHIs may be low, some have additional costs such as subscriptions for extra features or therapist guidance. Disengagement is commonly experienced during a depressive episode, hence, normalizing and expecting this can reduce shame and allow conversations with patients about compensatory strategies. Clinicians can also ask patients about the current use of other apps to identify features which may support DHI (Digital health intervention) use (e.g., gamification, notifications, and social networking integration). Sharing data with a health care provider or a trusted support may also help the user make sense of changes in mood states over time, as well as detect any adverse events.

Throughout these guidelines, all recommendations are accompanied by the level of evidence available to support each graded line of treatment. In addition, clinical support is used to rank recommendations, based on expert consensus from the CANMAT (Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments) editorial group on factors including safety, tolerability, and feasibility, where possible. A rigorous method ensures consensus among the editorial group, and new or controversial topics are highlighted to clarify the rationale for recommendations.

Treatment recommendations are then organized along the lines of treatment, based on both strength of the evidence and clinical support ( Table B ). Clinical support reflects expert consensus by the CANMAT (Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments) editorial group on tolerability, safety, and feasibility. First-line treatments require higher-quality evidence (Level 1 or Level 2 evidence) and generally should be considered first in decision-making. Second- and third-line treatments should usually be considered only when first-line treatments are ineffective or unavailable. Treatments with Level 1 evidence for efficacy may be downgraded to second-line or third-line recommendations due to clinical concerns such as safety and side effect profile. Note that recommendations for principles of care (e.g. in Q.1, Q.2 and Q.5) are based primarily on Level 3 or Level 4 evidence, such as expert consensus.

The exception is when treatments are grouped according to a class, such as medication mechanism of action. The symbols for the level of evidence presented in Table A (Level 1 (Level 1) , Level 2 (Level 2) , Level 3 (Level 3) , and Level 4 (Level 4) ) are used throughout the text to show the strength of evidence for statements and recommendations.

Methods > Grading of Recommendations > paragraph id: 13

The strength of evidence was evaluated based on the level of evidence criteria used in previous CANMAT (Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments) guidelines ( Table A ). We assessed the systematic reviews and meta-analyses for quality and risk of bias using modified global ratings from Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation)). The risk of bias for each study was assessed for methodology elements and rated as “Low” (few missing elements that are unlikely to affect the outcome), “Medium” (some missing elements that may possibly affect outcomes), and “High” (many missing or unclear elements, or clear bias in one element that is likely to affect the outcome). RCTs and other studies were considered when systematic reviews and meta-analyses were unavailable, with small-sample RCTs defined as those involving less than 30 participants per randomized condition. We use symbols to denote these levels of evidence ( Table A ) when referencing in the text (see conventions used in this document).

Question 7. What Should be Done When a Patient is not Better? > Q.7.a. What Contributes to a Poor Response to Treatment? > paragraph id: 181

Several clinical, comorbidity, and medication factors may contribute to insufficient treatment response ( Table 7.1 ). Comorbid psychiatric conditions associated with poor treatment response include anxiety disorders, ADHD (Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder), post-traumatic stress disorder, substance use disorders, and personality disorders. Comorbid nonpsychiatric medical conditions may also be associated with poor response to antidepressants. For example, undiagnosed sleep apnea may be an important contributor to persistent residual symptoms of insomnia, fatigue, and low motivation. Clinicians should also be aware that comorbid conditions do not remain static over time. Hence, regular reassessment is important for patients with persistent symptoms.

Stressful life events and circumstances, including interpersonal stress, job strain and insecurity, income inequality, and challenging living environment, are associated with an increased risk of developing MDD (Major depressive disorder) even when correcting for pre-existing depressive symptoms and comorbid other medical conditions. Bereavement is a normal process, but severe or prolonged grief also can increase the risk of an MDE (Major depressive episode). Other modifiable factors associated with a greater risk of MDD (Major depressive disorder) include a sedentary lifestyle, increased screen time watching television or using mobile devices, and shift work.

## Query 27
Should a patient on an antidepressant also see a therapist?

### Answer
Yes, when possible, combining psychological treatments with pharmacotherapy is more effective than either alone for acute treatment, and reduces the risk of recurrence.

Question 7. What Should be Done When a Patient is not Better? > Q.7.c. How are Strategies Sequenced When There is a Poor Response to an Initial Antidepressant Treatment? > paragraph id: 188

After optimizing the dose, the main medication options involve switching to another antidepressant or adding an adjunctive medication. The evidence for the efficacy of switching antidepressants is inconsistent. Meta-analyses show that switching to another antidepressant is not superior to continuing the same one (Level 2) and there appears to be diminishing response rates for antidepressant monotherapy beyond the first switch.

Question 3. How are Treatments Selected? > Q.3.h. Are Antidepressants Associated With an Increased Risk of Suicide? > paragraph id: 105

In summary, the initial few weeks before and after starting any treatment is a higher risk period for suicide. While antidepressants generally reduce suicidal ideation, a small proportion of patients may experience increased suicidal ideation when initiating antidepressants, especially young people. CANMAT (Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments) recommends routine monitoring of suicide risk for all patients during antidepressant treatment, with enhanced attention during the first 4 weeks following a new antidepressant prescription and after stopping the medication (Level 3) . With adolescent and young adult patients, in particular, clinicians should ensure that they are aware of the risk of increased suicidal thoughts and behaviours before initiating an antidepressant. Clinicians also should educate patients that if they experience an increase in suicidal thoughts when starting a new medication, they should (a) understand them as a medication side effect; (b) be aware that increasing suicidal thoughts indicate a need for urgent action to address distress and other symptoms; (c) implement a safety plan (see Q.2.c); and (d) reach out to their care provider, crisis line (e.g., call 9-8-8 in Canada and the USA (United States of America)), or an emergency department (Level 4) .

Figure 7.1. Algorithm for sequential treatment after suboptimal response to initial antidepressant medication.

**Start**

Assess factors that can interfere with treatment response:
    - Psychiatric and nonpsychiatric comorbidities
    - Adherence to treatment
    - Other biological and psychological factors which may interfere with response
    - Pharmacokinetic factors (consider pharmacogenetic testing)

-> **Optimize Dose**
    If another therapeutic dose, or partial response to well-tolerated lower doses within the therapeutic range.

-> **Consider Adding Psychological Treatments**
    Consider psychotherapy earlier rather than later in treatment

-> **Switch or Adjunctive Medication**
    Consider advantages and drawbacks for each strategy.

    -> **Switch to Another Antidepressant**
        Especially if there are intolerance issues with the initial antidepressant.
        -> **First Line:**
            Consider an antidepressant with a mechanism of action that is distinct from previous one.
            Consider an antidepressant with evidence of superior efficacy (Table 3.5).
        -> **Second Line:**
            Consider a second- or third-line antidepressant.

    -> **Add an Adjunctive Medication**
        Especially if there is a partial response to initial antidepressant and it is well tolerated.
        -> **First Line:**
            Aripiprazole, brexpiprazole.
            - Bupropion, N e-sketamine/lv
            - Ketamine, cariprazine, lithium, mittazapine, modafinil, olanzapine, quetiapine-XL, risperidone, triiodothyronine.
        -> **Second Line:**
            Other antidepressants, stimulants, TCAs, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, lamotrigine, pramipexole, zprasidone.
        -> **Third Line:**
            Adjunctive transcranial direct current stimulation for MDD (Major depressive disorder)
            Vagus nerve stimulation for DTD (Difficult-to-treat depression)

-> **Consider Adding Neuromodulation Treatments for TRD (Treatment-resistant depression)**
    These are generally considered after one of the switch of adjunctive medication options.
    -> **First Line:**
        Electroconvulsive therapy for severe MDE (Major depressive episode)
        Transcranial magnetic stimulation for TRD (Treatment-resistant depression)
    -> **Second Line:**
        Electroconvulsive therapy for DTD (Difficult-to-treat depression)

**End**

Note. This algorithm refers primarily to medication treatments. Psychological treatments (see Table 3.2) should also be considered when patients have suboptimal responses to an initial medication. Neuromodulation treatments (see Table 8.3) are generally considered after a switch or adjunctive medication strategy has failed (i.e., for treatment-resistant depression). DTD (Difficult-to-treat depression) = difficult-to-treat depression; MDD (Major depressive disorder) = major depressive disorder; TCA (Tricyclic antidepressants) = tricyclic antidepressant; IN = intranasal; IV = intravenous; TRD (Treatment-resistant depression) = treatment-resistant depression; XR = extended release.

## Query 28
I have a patient who often struggles with constipation Would paroxetine be  a good antidepressant to try first?

### Answer
While paroxetine is a first-line antidepressant, its risk of constipation is somewhat high, around 14%.  First line agents with less change of constipation include  escitalopram, sertraline, desvenlafaxine, vortioxetine, vilazodone and bupropion.

Question 7. What Should be Done When a Patient is not Better? > Q.7.g. What are the Risks and Benefits of Specific Adjunctive Medications? > Adjunctive Use of a Second Antidepressant > paragraph id: 201

Compared to serotonin-dopamine activity-modulating agents, antidepressants generally have a more favourable side effect profile when used as adjunctive treatment, but the evidence for efficacy is less robust. Meta-analyses find that adding a second antidepressant is associated with better treatment outcomes compared to switching, but there is significant heterogeneity across reports which limits confidence in the results (Level 2) . Adding mirtazapine/mianserin (antagonists of presynaptic α2-adrenoceptors) is superior to other combinations. Large RCTs have shown evidence for the effectiveness of adjunctive bupropion but the meta-analyses are inconclusive. Hence, these are recommended as second-line treatments for DTD (Difficult-to-treat depression). Adjunctive use of other antidepressants, including TCAs, continues to be recommended as a third line due to limited evidence and safety/tolerability issues among older agents.

Question 3. How are Treatments Selected? > Q.3.e. How is a Pharmacological Treatment Selected? > paragraph id: 91

Regarding efficacy, 8 antidepressant medications (bupropion, escitalopram, mirtazapine, paroxetine, sertraline, venlafaxine-XR, vortioxetine, and agomelatine) have evidence for superior response, although these are in the range of 5 to 10 percentage points difference versus comparator medications. Acceptability (all-cause discontinuation rates in meta-analyses) is also more favourable for several medications. For drug interactions (see Q.3.j), fluoxetine, fluvoxamine and paroxetine have clinically relevant potential interactions with other medications. Citalopram carries a risk of QTc prolongation; however, the clinical risk is low, and citalopram has been used safely in large trials of MDD (Major depressive disorder) with comorbid cardiovascular disease (note that escitalopram does not carry a clinically relevant higher risk of QTc prolongation). Most antidepressants have a risk of elevation of liver function tests (LFTs, see Q.3.j), but agomelatine includes the requirement for regular monitoring of LFTs in its product monograph.

Question 7. What Should be Done When a Patient is not Better? > Q.7.g. What are the Risks and Benefits of Specific Adjunctive Medications? > Serotonin-Dopamine Activity Modulators (Low-Dose Atypical Antipsychotics) > paragraph id: 198

Adjunctive treatment with serotonin-dopamine activity modulators (also known as atypical antipsychotic agents) has the most consistent evidence for efficacy in DTD (Difficult-to-treat depression) ( Table 7.2 ). Typically, lower doses of these medications are used for adjunctive treatment in MDD (Major depressive disorder) compared to other conditions such as bipolar disorder or schizophrenia. Most of the listed medications have evidence for efficacy, with network meta-analyses showing that they are more efficacious than placebo (Level 1) . Aripiprazole and brexpiprazole are listed as first-line agents because of their efficacy and tolerability profile. Cariprazine is recommended as the second-line because there are fewer studies compared to the other agents. Ziprasidone is included as a third-line recommendation because of mixed efficacy results in RCTs and network meta-analyses.

This application is currently using the 2023 update of the CANMAT guidelines, published in 2024. At the time of its publication, digital health applications for direct-use by pateints had limited evidence. Applications should be assede for whether their techniques are evidence-based and evaluated on real-world populations. Other important factors include the privacy and security of the tool, the potential for providing harmful or inaccurate advice, and whether the patient may experience any barriers

Question 4. What is the Role of DHIs? > Q.4.b. What are Best Practices for Evaluating DHIs? > paragraph id: 134

Many individuals with depression are interested in using DHIs to support their mental health care but they often face challenges when looking for evidence-informed, engaging, and safe DHIs. Commercially available DHIs for depression are often promoted by internet or app store search algorithms, which prioritize popularity and often fail to disclose criteria for efficacy, safety, privacy, and security of personal health information. Positive user reviews may contain anecdotal evidence of utility, but they do not necessarily correlate with expert evaluation. While DHIs developed by academic researchers may be free of commercial bias and have a more robust evidence base, they are seldom publicly available.

Question 4. What is the Role of DHIs? > Q.4.e. What are Examples of Unguided (Self-Directed) DHIs? > paragraph id: 148

More recently, some self-directed DHIs have introduced artificial intelligence (AI (Artificial intelligence)) to provide interactive feedback and simulate human conversation. These conversational agents, known as chatbots, can be programmed with either predefined responses, usually given by text but sometimes by voice, or free-range responses that are generated by AI (Artificial intelligence) algorithms. Chatbots potentially can provide personalized and tailored components of interventions, such as CBT (Cognitive-behavioural therapy), through interactive conversations while offering a sense of empathy, understanding, and nonjudgmental support. However, the clinical application of chatbots is still at an early stage and little is known about potential risks (such as inappropriate responses) from these AI (Artificial intelligence) systems. A recent meta-analysis summarized 4 trials in adults with depressive and anxiety symptoms; while chatbots had significant benefits compared to control conditions, only 1 trial included the diagnosis of MDD (Major depressive disorder) and the results were graded as low quality because of the small sample size and high-risk of bias (Level 3) . Hence, there is currently insufficient evidence to recommend chatbots and conversational agents for the treatment of MDD (Major depressive disorder).

Question 4. What is the Role of DHIs? > Q.4.b. What are Best Practices for Evaluating DHIs? > paragraph id: 138

Access, cost, and ease of use are also important aspects, particularly for users with disabilities or language/literacy issues. While up-front costs for many DHIs may be low, some have additional costs such as subscriptions for extra features or therapist guidance. Disengagement is commonly experienced during a depressive episode, hence, normalizing and expecting this can reduce shame and allow conversations with patients about compensatory strategies. Clinicians can also ask patients about the current use of other apps to identify features which may support DHI (Digital health intervention) use (e.g., gamification, notifications, and social networking integration). Sharing data with a health care provider or a trusted support may also help the user make sense of changes in mood states over time, as well as detect any adverse events.

## Query 30
How do I know if an antidepressant is working?

### Answer
The guidelines recommend the use of measurement-based care, which involves the routine use of validated outcome scales which are reviewed the pateints, and are used alongside clinical assesement to support collaborative decision-making. Examples of validated scales include patient-rated scales like the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), and clinican-rated scalces such as the Hamilton DEpression Rating Scale (HAM-D).

Question 5. How is Treatment Monitored? > Q.5.d. What Laboratory Tests Should be Monitored During Treatment? > paragraph id: 164

Routine laboratory tests are not necessary to monitor antidepressant treatment for MDD (Major depressive disorder) ( Table 5.1 ), although some blood tests are indicated in specific clinical situations 7. For instance, liver function tests should be done at baseline and every 6 to 12 months in patients with pre-existing liver diseases, and serum electrolyte monitoring should be considered for older patients (age 60 years and older) as they are more susceptible to hyponatremia with antidepressants (Level 4) . Moreover, when adjunctive agents (e.g., lithium, atypical antipsychotics, and ketamine) are used, lab tests tailored to the specific medication should be monitored. For example, patients taking lithium should have blood tests (lithium levels, electrolytes, calcium, creatinine, eGFR, and TSH) checked at baseline and every 6 to 12 months thereafter, or whenever the clinical status or lithium dose changes. For those on longer-term ketamine/esketamine treatment, periodic urinalysis is recommended to check for cystitis, a potential long-term side effect of ketamine use.

## Query 31
When a patient is better, how long should they continue their antidepressant for?

### Answer
We recommend that antidepressents be maintained for 6 to 12 months after a patient achieves remission unless a patient has risk factors for the recurrence of depressive factors, in which case treatment should be continued for 2 years or more. These risk factors include residual symptoms, chronic depressive episodes, medical comorbidities, greater number of previous episodes, poor social support, or persistent stressful life events.

Question 6. What Should be Done When a Patient is Better? > Q.6.c. Who Needs Longer-Term Antidepressant Treatment? > paragraph id: 174

For patients with risk factors for recurrence, antidepressant treatment should be continued for 2 years or more (Level 3) ( Table 6.1 ). Support tools using machine learning algorithms have been developed to estimate the risk of recurrence based on an individual's risk profile, to assist clinicians and patients in making informed decisions about maintenance treatments. These risk-prediction models look promising, but further validation is required before they can be recommended for clinical use.

Question 6. What Should be Done When a Patient is Better? > Q.6.b. How is Recurrence Prevented? > paragraph id: 170

The 2016 CANMAT (Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments) guidelines recommended that patients maintain treatment with antidepressants for 6 to 9 months after achieving symptomatic remission. New meta-regression evidence suggests that extending maintenance treatment for 6 to 12 months after remission adds benefit compared to stopping before 6 months (Level 1) . Hence, the recommendation has been adjusted to maintain antidepressants for 6 to 12 months after remission ( Table 6.1 ).

Question 6. What Should be Done When a Patient is Better? > Q.6.c. Who Needs Longer-Term Antidepressant Treatment? > paragraph id: 173

While 6 to 12 months of maintenance antidepressant treatment is recommended for all patients, some will require longer-term maintenance because they have risk factors for recurrence and chronicity ( Table 6.2 ). Most risk factors are longitudinal and part of a continuum of exposure to depression and other psychological stressors throughout the lifespan. A systematic meta-review identified residual symptoms and a history of maltreatment or abuse during childhood as robust risk factors for recurrence. Other risk factors, including longer episode duration and greater severity of depressive episodes, have less evidence to support a higher risk of recurrence. Some evidence suggests that prior depressive episodes and residual symptoms could indicate a kindling effect, in which subsequent depressive episodes are triggered by milder stressors, and whereby certain individual characteristics such as early childhood adversity and neuroticism may contribute to a heightened sensitivity to life stressors over time.

Question 6. What Should be Done When a Patient is Better? > Q.6.b. How is Recurrence Prevented? > Table 6.1. > paragraph id: 169

Table 6.1. Summary Recommendations for Maintenance Antidepressant Treatment.

The table presents a summary of recommendations for the treatment of depression, categorized into four levels of evidence. The first line of treatment is divided into two columns: "Line of treatment" and "Level of evidence." The "Line of treatment" column lists the recommendations, while the "Level of evidence" column indicates the level of evidence supporting each recommendation.

The first line of treatment includes the following recommendations:

*   For patients who have achieved symptom remission, using maintenance pharmacotherapy and/or psychotherapy can prevent recurrence.
	*   **Level of evidence**: Level 1

*   All patients treated with antidepressants should continue medication treatment for a minimum of 6 to 12 months after achieving symptomatic remission.
	*   **Level of evidence**: Level 1

*   Patients with risk factors for recurrence (see Table 6.2) should continue antidepressant treatment for 2 years or more.
	*   **Level of evidence**: Level 3

*   Patients with recurrent and severe MDEs should use sequential treatment (adding psychotherapy after stabilizing on medications) to prevent recurrence.
	*   **Level of evidence**: Level 1

*   When a decision is made to stop the antidepressant, it should be tapered gradually, whenever possible, for several weeks or months with more time between dose reductions near the end of the taper.
	*   **Level of evidence**: Level 3

*   For patients treated with medication for less than 4 weeks, the antidepressant can be tapered and discontinued quickly, over 2 weeks or less.
	*   **Level of evidence**: Level 3

*   Psychological treatments can be added before or during antidepressant discontinuation to help patients stop the antidepressant.
	*   **Level of evidence**: Level 2

Figure 7.1. Algorithm for sequential treatment after suboptimal response to initial antidepressant medication.

**Start**

Assess factors that can interfere with treatment response:
    - Psychiatric and nonpsychiatric comorbidities
    - Adherence to treatment
    - Other biological and psychological factors which may interfere with response
    - Pharmacokinetic factors (consider pharmacogenetic testing)

-> **Optimize Dose**
    If another therapeutic dose, or partial response to well-tolerated lower doses within the therapeutic range.

-> **Consider Adding Psychological Treatments**
    Consider psychotherapy earlier rather than later in treatment

-> **Switch or Adjunctive Medication**
    Consider advantages and drawbacks for each strategy.

    -> **Switch to Another Antidepressant**
        Especially if there are intolerance issues with the initial antidepressant.
        -> **First Line:**
            Consider an antidepressant with a mechanism of action that is distinct from previous one.
            Consider an antidepressant with evidence of superior efficacy (Table 3.5).
        -> **Second Line:**
            Consider a second- or third-line antidepressant.

    -> **Add an Adjunctive Medication**
        Especially if there is a partial response to initial antidepressant and it is well tolerated.
        -> **First Line:**
            Aripiprazole, brexpiprazole.
            - Bupropion, N e-sketamine/lv
            - Ketamine, cariprazine, lithium, mittazapine, modafinil, olanzapine, quetiapine-XL, risperidone, triiodothyronine.
        -> **Second Line:**
            Other antidepressants, stimulants, TCAs, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, lamotrigine, pramipexole, zprasidone.
        -> **Third Line:**
            Adjunctive transcranial direct current stimulation for MDD (Major depressive disorder)
            Vagus nerve stimulation for DTD (Difficult-to-treat depression)

-> **Consider Adding Neuromodulation Treatments for TRD (Treatment-resistant depression)**
    These are generally considered after one of the switch of adjunctive medication options.
    -> **First Line:**
        Electroconvulsive therapy for severe MDE (Major depressive episode)
        Transcranial magnetic stimulation for TRD (Treatment-resistant depression)
    -> **Second Line:**
        Electroconvulsive therapy for DTD (Difficult-to-treat depression)

**End**

Note. This algorithm refers primarily to medication treatments. Psychological treatments (see Table 3.2) should also be considered when patients have suboptimal responses to an initial medication. Neuromodulation treatments (see Table 8.3) are generally considered after a switch or adjunctive medication strategy has failed (i.e., for treatment-resistant depression). DTD (Difficult-to-treat depression) = difficult-to-treat depression; MDD (Major depressive disorder) = major depressive disorder; TCA (Tricyclic antidepressants) = tricyclic antidepressant; IN = intranasal; IV = intravenous; TRD (Treatment-resistant depression) = treatment-resistant depression; XR = extended release.

Question 7. What Should be Done When a Patient is not Better? > Q.7.a. What Contributes to a Poor Response to Treatment? > paragraph id: 180

In real-world populations, approximately half of patients with MDD (Major depressive disorder) achieve response (>50% reduction in symptom severity) after 8 weeks of antidepressant monotherapy, while about a third attain full symptom remission; only a quarter of nonremitters who receive a second pharmacological treatment will reach remission. For first-treatment patients, the remission rates are higher, but almost half will not achieve remission with antidepressants after 6 months of treatment. Hence, inadequate response to treatment is a common clinical challenge.

Question 7. What Should be Done When a Patient is not Better? > Q.7.c. How are Strategies Sequenced When There is a Poor Response to an Initial Antidepressant Treatment? > paragraph id: 184

The first steps in the assessment of poor response involve re-evaluating the diagnosis (e.g., a missed diagnosis of bipolar disorder), comorbidities, and adherence to treatment. In addition to clinical reassessment, laboratory investigations should be considered to rule out potential medical factors that can contribute to persistent symptoms and that require additional interventions. Pharmacogenetic testing may be helpful to identify pharmacokinetic reasons for poor response or unusual severity of adverse effects. Systematic, sequential, and MBC (Measurement-based care) may enhance outcomes for MDD (Major depressive disorder) when initial treatments are not fully effective (Level 2) .

## Query 33
I am considering referring my patient to ECT for their depression. Would I need to stop their medications?

### Answer
Antidepressants and other medications can usually be continued during ECT treatment. A meta-analysis found that concurrent use of antidepressants during a course of ECT improved outcomes, but this was low-quality evidence based on older trials. Some concomitant medications may interfere with ECT efficacy (e.g., benzodiazepines and anticonvulsant medications) or worsen cognitive side effects (lithium and cannabis), and should be discontinued or held before ECT.

Antidepressants and other medications can usually be continued during ECT (Electroconvulsive therapy) treatment (Level 2) . A meta-analysis found that concurrent use of antidepressants during a course of ECT (Electroconvulsive therapy) improved outcomes, but this was low-quality evidence based on older trials. Ketamine has not been shown to improve outcomes with ECT (Electroconvulsive therapy), whether as an anaesthetic agent or with single-dose IV infusions given during a course of ECT (Electroconvulsive therapy). Some concomitant medications may interfere with ECT (Electroconvulsive therapy) efficacy (e.g., benzodiazepines and anticonvulsant medications) or worsen cognitive side effects (lithium and cannabis), and should be discontinued or held before ECT (Electroconvulsive therapy).

ECT (Electroconvulsive therapy) has demonstrated evidence of efficacy and tolerability in the treatment of depressive episodes, with response rates ranging from 65% to 75% (Level 1) . ECT (Electroconvulsive therapy) may be especially effective in older patients, those with psychotic or catatonic features, and more severely depressed patients. Importantly, results of retrospective cohort analyses conclude that the benefits of ECT (Electroconvulsive therapy) outweigh the risks among hospitalized MDD (Major depressive disorder) patients, with no evidence of increased risk of serious medical events. Furthermore, ECT (Electroconvulsive therapy) significantly reduced the risk of suicide in the year after discharge from hospital.

Question 8. When Should Neuromodulation Treatments be Used? > Q.8.b. What Noninvasive Neuromodulation Treatments are Available? > Electroconvulsive Therapy > paragraph id: 220

Although ECT (Electroconvulsive therapy) has high response rates during acute treatment, recurrence occurs in 60% to 80% of patients at 6-month follow-up. Given the high recurrence rate, a maintenance strategy should be implemented following ECT (Electroconvulsive therapy), with either pharmacotherapy or continuation ECT (Electroconvulsive therapy). Unfortunately, there is only limited data to guide this treatment choice. Continuation ECT (Electroconvulsive therapy) (administered at increasing intervals from once a week to once a month) shows better efficacy in preventing recurrence after ECT (Electroconvulsive therapy), compared to maintenance pharmacotherapy (Level 2) . However, few medications have been systematically studied for maintenance pharmacotherapy. Lithium, when combined with either nortriptyline or venlafaxine-XR, is shown to be superior for relapse prevention compared to either antidepressant alone (Level 2) . There are no differences in cognitive outcomes between maintenance ECT (Electroconvulsive therapy) and pharmacotherapy. Given this limited evidence, the choice for maintenance treatment following successful ECT (Electroconvulsive therapy) must consider factors such as previous ECT (Electroconvulsive therapy) responses, episode severity and degree of treatment resistance, consequences of recurrence, adverse effects experienced during ECT (Electroconvulsive therapy), and patient preference.
