## Query 4
My patient has a major depressive episode with somatic symptoms of fatigue, what would be the first choice medication for them?

### Answer
Bupropion

## Response
* **First-line medication recommendations for major depressive episode with somatic symptoms of fatigue:**
  * The provided clinical guidelines context does not explicitly mention the first choice medication for a major depressive episode with somatic symptoms of fatigue. However, we can infer from the information provided in Table 7.2 that the first-line adjunctive medications for difficult-to-treat depression (DTD) include:
    + Aripiprazole: 2-10 mg, Level 1
    + Brexpiprazole*: 0.5-2 mg, Level 1
  * These medications are recommended as first-line treatments, but it is essential to consider the patient's specific symptoms, treatment history, and preferences when selecting a medication.
* **Reference:** [Reference 1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#table26-07067437241245384)
* **Important consideration:** When selecting a medication, it is crucial to consider the patient's overall health, potential drug interactions, and the medication's side effect profile. In this case, since the patient is experiencing fatigue, a medication with a lower risk of exacerbating fatigue or improving energy levels might be preferred.
* **Additional consideration:** Although not explicitly mentioned in the context, bupropion, a second-line medication listed in Table 7.2, is known for its energizing effects and might be considered for patients with fatigue. However, this would depend on the patient's specific circumstances and the clinician's professional judgment.
* **Reference:** [Reference 2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#table26-07067437241245384)

## Query 5
My patient with a major depressive episode of mild severity would like to try psychotherapy. What are the first-line options?

### Answer
Cognitive behavioural therapy, interpersonal therapy, and behavioural activation

## Response
* **First-line psychotherapy options for a patient with a major depressive episode of mild severity:**
  + The clinical guidelines context does not explicitly state the first-line psychotherapy options for mild major depressive episodes. However, it can be inferred from the information provided for moderate severity episodes.
  + For MDE of moderate severity, **structured psychotherapy** (specifically, **Cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT)**) is recommended as an initial treatment option, with equal efficacy to antidepressant medication in the short term (Level 1 evidence) [**Reference:** https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#section5A-07067437241245384].
  + CBT is also more efficacious than antidepressants at 6- to 12-month follow-up, making it a preferred option for long-term treatment.
* **Treatment considerations:**
  + The choice between psychotherapy and antidepressant medication depends on context, availability, and patient preference.
  + The combination of antidepressant medication and psychotherapy can also be considered (Level 2 evidence) [**Reference:** https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#section5A-07067437241245384].

    - **Reference:** https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#table16-07067437241245384

These options are preferred due to their higher level of evidence and recommendation by CANMAT (Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments) for mild major depressive episodes. It's essential to discuss these options with the patient, considering their preferences and the potential benefits and limitations of each treatment.

### Important Considerations

- Patient preference plays a significant role in depression management, and shared decision-making is crucial.
- **Reference:** https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#section4D-07067437241245384
- The level of evidence for CAM treatments varies, with St. John's Wort having the highest level of evidence (Level 1) for mild MDE.
- **Reference:** https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#table1-07067437241245384 for understanding the levels of evidence.
- Other CAM treatments like saffron, lavender, and roseroot are recommended as third-line treatments due to their modest benefit and lower level of evidence (Level 3).
- **Reference:** https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#section5M-07067437241245384 and https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#table16-07067437241245384 for details on these treatments.

## Query 7
My patient is presenting with a mild severity major depressive episode. All other things being equal and accessible, what does CANMAT recommend for treatment?

### Answer
Psychotherapy because of fewer side effects, although psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy are equally effective

## Response
* **Treatment Recommendation for Mild Severity Major Depressive Episode:**
    + Unfortunately, the provided Clinical Guidelines Context does not explicitly state the recommended treatment for a mild severity major depressive episode according to CANMAT.
    + The context mainly discusses the scope, target audience, and updates of the CANMAT guidelines for managing Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) in adults, but does not provide specific treatment recommendations for mild severity cases.
* **Reference:** [CANMAT Guidelines](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#sec4)
* **Inference:** While the guidelines emphasize a collaborative, personalized, and systematic management approach, they do not provide explicit treatment recommendations for mild severity major depressive episodes in the given context. 
* **Conclusion:** No clear recommendation found in the clinical guideline for the specific treatment of mild severity major depressive episodes.


---

## Query 8
My patient's depression has not responded to the medication dose I started them on a four weeks ago.  What should I do next?

### Answer
Optimize the dose

## Response
* **Next Steps for Non-Responsive Depression Treatment:**
  * If the patient has not shown early improvement (20% or greater reduction in symptoms) after 4 weeks of antidepressant treatment, consider either increasing the dose or switching the antidepressant, taking into account tolerability concerns.
  * **Increasing the Dose:** Optimizing the antidepressant dose is an important first step, as higher than minimal therapeutic doses are more effective, but may be less well-tolerated (Level 1 evidence).
  * **Switching or Adding Medication:** After optimizing the dose, the main medication options involve switching to another antidepressant or adding an adjunctive medication. However, the evidence for switching antidepressants is inconsistent, with meta-analyses showing no superiority over continuing the same medication (Level 2 evidence).
* **Reference:** [Clinical Guidelines for Treating Depression](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#section9D-07067437241245384) and [Grading of Recommendations](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#table1-07067437241245384)
* **Preferred Approach:** Increasing the dose is a preferred initial approach due to its established effectiveness (Level 1 evidence), but the decision to switch or add medication should be made on a patient-specific basis, considering factors such as tolerability and potential side effects.


---

## Query 9
My patient's depression has not responded to the SSRI medication I started them on, even after I optimized and increased the dose up to where they could still tolerate the side effects. I haven't tried anything else yet. What should I do now?

### Answer
If available, consider referral to psychotherapy for CBT, IPT, or behavioural activation

## Response
### Recommendations for Next Steps in Treatment

Given that the patient's depression has not responded to the SSRI medication, even after optimizing and increasing the dose, the following options are considered:

*   **Switching to another antidepressant**: The evidence for the efficacy of switching antidepressants is inconsistent, with meta-analyses showing that switching to another antidepressant is not superior to continuing the same one (Level 2). However, this option may still be considered if the patient has not responded to the initial treatment.
*   **Adding an adjunctive medication**: This option involves adding a medication to the existing treatment regimen, which may help to enhance the therapeutic effect.

**Reference:** [Clinical Guidelines Context](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#section9C-07067437241245384)

When considering alternative medications, it's essential to take into account the potential side effects and therapeutic doses of different medications. Table 3.4 provides a comprehensive overview of the side effects of various medications, including SSRIs, SNRIs, and others.

**Reference:** [Table 3.4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#table13-07067437241245384)

The CANMAT criteria for grading recommendations can help guide the decision-making process. Level 1 evidence, which includes high-quality meta-analyses with narrow confidence intervals and/or 2 or more RCTs with adequate sample size, is considered the highest level of evidence.

**Reference:** [Table A](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#table1-07067437241245384)

Ultimately, the decision to switch or add medications should be based on a thorough evaluation of the patient's individual needs and medical history.

## Query 10
My patient's depression has not responded to the SSRI medication I started them on, even after I optimized and increased the dose up to where they could still tolerate the side effects. They are not interested in psychotherapy. What should I do now?

### Answer
Since there is tolerability issues and no response, consider switching to an antidepressant of a different class such as an SNRI

## Response
* **Next Steps for Treatment-Resistant Depression:**
  * After optimizing the dose of the initial SSRI medication and considering the patient's lack of interest in psychotherapy, the main medication options involve:
    + Switching to another antidepressant
    + Adding an adjunctive medication
  * **Reference:** [Clinical Guidelines Context](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#section9C-07067437241245384)
* **Evidence for Switching Antidepressants:**
  * Meta-analyses show that switching to another antidepressant is not superior to continuing the same one (Level 2 evidence)
  * There appears to be diminishing response rates for antidepressant monotherapy beyond the first switch
  * **Reference:** [Clinical Guidelines Context](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#section9C-07067437241245384)
* **Level of Evidence:**

## Query 11
My patient's depression achieved a partial response to the SSRI medication I started them on, but the improvements have been less than hoped. They are not experiencing any side effects from the SSRI. What should I do?

### Answer
Start them on adjunctive aripiprazole or brexpiprazole

## Response
### Recommendations for Patient with Partial Response to SSRI

Given that your patient has achieved a partial response to the SSRI medication but without significant side effects, the next steps can be considered based on the provided clinical guidelines context:

*   **Assessment of Early Improvement**: According to the guidelines, early improvement (often defined as a 20% or greater reduction in scores on a symptom rating scale within the first 4 weeks) predicts a later response. If early improvement is not seen by 4 weeks, the likelihood of response or remission at 8 to 12 weeks is low. Since your patient has shown some improvement, it's essential to continue monitoring their progress.
*   **Dose Increase or Switching Antidepressants**: The guidelines suggest that if there's no early improvement by 4 weeks, the decision should be to either increase the dose or switch the antidepressant, especially if there are tolerability concerns. Since your patient is not experiencing side effects, increasing the dose of the current SSRI could be a viable option to enhance the therapeutic effect.
*   **Switching to a Different Antidepressant**: If increasing the dose does not yield further improvement, or if the patient experiences intolerable side effects, switching to a different antidepressant should be considered. The choice of a new antidepressant can be guided by the patient's specific symptoms, potential side effects, and the mechanism of action of the medication. For example, switching from an SSRI to an SNRI (Serotonin-Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitor) might be considered for patients who have not responded adequately to SSRIs.

### Preferred Options

1.  **Increase the Dose of the Current SSRI**: Given the patient's partial response and lack of side effects, increasing the dose of the current SSRI is a reasonable first step. This approach aims to maximize the therapeutic benefit of the current medication before considering a switch.
2.  **Switch to a Different Antidepressant**: If increasing the dose does not lead to significant further improvement, switching to a different antidepressant, such as an SNRI, could be the next step. The choice of the new medication should be based on the patient's clinical profile and the side effect profile of the medications.

## Query 12
My patient's severe major depressive episode did not respond to an SSRI, and did not respond to SNRI after switching to it. I tried adding adjunctive pharmacotherapy as well but it did not work. What should I do now?

### Answer
ECT

## Response
* **Next Steps for Treatment-Resistant Depression:** 
    + Given that the patient's severe major depressive episode did not respond to an SSRI and then an SNRI, and adjunctive pharmacotherapy was also ineffective, it's essential to consider alternative approaches.
    + **Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT):** As suggested in the clinical guidelines, CBT is recommended as a second-line adjunctive treatment for difficult-to-treat depression (DTD) [**Reference:** https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#section9H-07067437241245384].
    + **Reevaluation of Symptoms:** Reassessing the patient's symptom dimensions, such as cognitive dysfunction, sleep disturbance, or somatic symptoms, may help guide the selection of alternative medications or therapies [**Reference:** https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#table15-07067437241245384].
* **Medication Considerations:**
    + For cognitive dysfunction, medications like vortioxetine, bupropion, or duloxetine may be considered [**Reference:** https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#table15-07067437241245384].
    + The patient's specific symptom profile and treatment history should be taken into account when selecting a new medication or therapy.
* **Importance of Evidence-Based Recommendations:**
    + The Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) guidelines provide a framework for evaluating the level of evidence supporting different treatment options [**Reference:** https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#table1-07067437241245384].
    + When possible, treatments with higher levels of evidence (e.g., Level 1 or 2) should be preferred over those with lower levels of evidence.

## Query 13
I am about to start my patient on an antidepressant, but I am worried about their likelihood to adhere to medications, and they have abruptly stopped in the past. What medications have the highest risk of antidepressant discontinuation syndrome?

### Answer
Paroxetine and Venlafaxine

## Response
* **Medications with High Risk of Antidepressant Discontinuation Syndrome:**
  + Paroxetine
  + Venlafaxine
* **Reason for High Risk:** These medications have a shorter half-life, which is associated with a greater incidence and severity of discontinuation symptoms, as well as a quicker onset.
* **Reference:** [Clinical Guidelines Context](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#section8D-07067437241245384) and [Table 6.3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#section8-07067437241245384)
* **Important Consideration:** Gradual tapering of antidepressants may help reduce the frequency and severity of discontinuation symptoms, and psychological support may also be beneficial. However, it is essential to differentiate discontinuation symptoms from early symptoms of recurrence to avoid unnecessary prolongation of antidepressant use.

## Query 15
My patient who I have been treating on antidepressant medication is no longer feeling any of their depressive symptoms. How long should they be on maintenance treatment for?

### Answer
A minimum of 6 to 12 months

## Response
* **Maintenance Treatment Duration**: The recommended duration for maintenance treatment with antidepressants after achieving symptomatic remission is **6 to 12 months**.
* **Reasoning**: This recommendation is based on new meta-regression evidence suggesting that extending maintenance treatment for 6 to 12 months after remission adds benefit compared to stopping before 6 months, with a **Level 1** evidence rating.
* **Reference**: [https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#section8B-07067437241245384](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#section8B-07067437241245384)
* **Additional Considerations**:
  + Patients with risk factors for recurrence should continue antidepressant treatment for **2 years or more** (Level 3 evidence).
  + Patients with recurrent and severe major depressive episodes should use sequential treatment (adding psychotherapy after stabilizing on medications) to prevent recurrence (Level 1 evidence).
  + When stopping antidepressants, they should be tapered gradually over several weeks or months (Level 3 evidence).

## Query 16
My patient has had recurrent depressive episodes, and has now once again had their symptoms relieved by the medications I've prescribed. They want longer-lasting benefits and want help with preventing recurrent episodes in the future. What should can I offer them?

### Answer
Suggest adding psychotherapy such as CBT to be sequentially added once the acute phase of depression is over.

## Response
To help prevent recurrent depressive episodes in your patient, consider the following options:

* **Maintenance pharmacotherapy**: Continue the patient's current medication for at least 6 to 12 months after achieving symptomatic remission to reduce relapse rates by 50% compared to placebo. 
* **Psychotherapy**: Offer booster sessions or maintenance psychotherapy to help the patient retain and encourage strategies to maintain remission.

These options are preferred because they are supported by **Level 1 evidence**, which includes high-quality meta-analysis with narrow confidence intervals and/or 2 or more RCTs with adequate sample size, as defined in [Table A. CANMAT Criteria for Level of Evidence](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#table1-07067437241245384).

Additionally, consider the patient's risk factors for recurrence, such as residual symptoms, history of maltreatment or abuse during childhood, and prior depressive episodes, as outlined in [Table 6.2. Risk Factors for Recurrence of Depressive Episodes](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#section8-07067437241245384). If the patient has these risk factors, they may require longer-term maintenance antidepressant treatment.

**Reference:** [https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#section8B-07067437241245384](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#section8B-07067437241245384)

## Query 17
I am about to start my patient on citalopram. Is there any monitoring or investigations I should order for them based on the guidelines?

### Answer
ECG to check for QTc

## Response
**Monitoring and Investigations for Citalopram:**

* **QTc Interval Monitoring:** Citalopram has a notable consideration for QTc interval prolongation, which may require monitoring. 
* **Weight, Glucose, and Lipid Profiles:** Although citalopram is neutral in terms of weight gain, it is still recommended to monitor weight, glucose, and lipid profiles at baseline and every 6 months when prescribing medications associated with weight gain, as a general principle of care.
* **Laboratory and Imaging Tests:** Obtain laboratory and imaging tests only when clinically indicated.

**Reference:** 
- [Table 3.5](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#table14-07067437241245384) for the comparison of antidepressants, including citalopram.

## Query 20
My patient with a moderate severity major depressive episode has tried an SSRI, without good effect, and now wants to try an SNRI. Their top priority is efficacy, and they are not concerned about any specific side effects. What's the best option for them?

### Answer
Venlafaxine-XR

## Response
* **Best Option for Patient:** 
    + Given the patient's moderate severity major depressive episode and lack of response to SSRI, an SNRI is a suitable option.
    + The patient's top priority is efficacy, and they are not concerned about specific side effects.
    + **Duloxetine** is a recommended SNRI, especially for patients with cognitive symptoms, comorbid pain conditions, energy, fatigue, and motivation symptoms.
* **Reason for Preference:**
    + The 2016 CANMAT guidelines suggest that SNRIs, such as duloxetine, may have superior efficacy for cognitive dysfunction compared to SSRIs (Level 2 evidence) [**Reference:** https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#section5G-07067437241245384].
    + Duloxetine also shows more benefits for comorbid pain conditions compared to SSRIs.
* **Additional Considerations:**
    + Patient age may be a relevant factor in antidepressant selection. However, since the patient's age is not specified, it is essential to consider individual factors and potential interactions.
    + The safety considerations of antidepressants, including SNRIs, should be discussed with the patient, especially regarding the increased risk of certain adverse events in specific age groups [**Reference:** https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#section5J-07067437241245384].

## Query 26
What are r isk factors for depression?

### Answer
There are numerous risk factors for major depressive disorder. These include family history, history of adverse childhood expereinces, comorbid medical ilnesses, comorbid substance use. There are also social and enviromental risk factors, such as stressful life events, job strain, income inequlity, bulling, sedentary life style, and working night shifts.

## Response
* **Risk Factors for Depression:**
  + Static, nonmodifiable risk factors:
    - Female sex
    - Family history of mood disorders
    - History of adverse childhood events/maltreatment
    - Death of spouse
  + Dynamic, potentially modifiable risk factors:
    - Chronic and nonpsychiatric medical illnesses
    - Psychiatric comorbidities, especially anxiety disorders
    - Alcohol and substance use disorders
    - Insomnia, night shift work
    - Periods of hormonal changes (e.g., puberty, pregnancy, postpartum, and perimenopause)
    - Recent stressful life events
    - Job strain/income inequality
    - Bereavement
    - Peer victimization/bullying/cyberbullying
    - Gender dysphoria
    - Sedentary lifestyle/screen time
* **Reference:** [Table 1.1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#table1-07067437241245384) 
  and [Section Q.1.a](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#section3-07067437241245384) provide the list of risk factors for Major Depressive Disorder (MDD).

## Query 27
Should a patient on an antidepressant also see a therapist?

### Answer
Yes, when possible, combining psychological treatments with pharmacotherapy is more effective than either alone for acute treatment, and reduces the risk of recurrence.

## Response
* **Recommendation for Therapy**: 
    + A patient on an antidepressant may benefit from seeing a therapist, specifically through **Cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT)**, as it has been found to be effective in reducing depressive symptoms and increasing response and remission rates when added to usual care, including antidepressants, for Difficult-to-treat depression (DTD).
    + **Psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy** is also considered, but it is viewed as an investigational treatment due to methodological issues and lack of long-term safety data.
* **Reasoning**: The recommendation for CBT is based on moderate-quality evidence from a Cochrane review, which found it to be effective as a second-line adjunctive treatment for DTD.
* **Reference**: [https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#section9H-07067437241245384](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#section9H-07067437241245384) 
* **Patient-Specific Factors**: The decision to recommend therapy should be based on a personalized care approach, taking into account the patient's values, preferences, and treatment history, as emphasized in the updated guidelines.
* **Reference**: [https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#sec3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#sec3)

## Query 28
I have a patient who often struggles with constipation Would paroxetine be  a good antidepressant to try first?

### Answer
While paroxetine is a first-line antidepressant, its risk of constipation is somewhat high, around 14%.  First line agents with less change of constipation include  escitalopram, sertraline, desvenlafaxine, vortioxetine, vilazodone and bupropion.

## Response
* **Medication Recommendation:** Paroxetine is not the most ideal antidepressant for a patient who struggles with constipation. 
* **Reasoning:** While paroxetine is one of the antidepressants with evidence for superior response, it has clinically relevant potential interactions with other medications and is a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6, which can increase blood levels of concurrent medications. 
* **Alternative Options:** Other antidepressants like escitalopram or sertraline may be more suitable as they have fewer clinically relevant effects on CYP isoenzymes and lower risk for drug interactions.
* **Reference:** [Clinical Guidelines Context](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#section5E-07067437241245384) and [Safety Concerns and Drug Interactions](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#section5J-07067437241245384)
* **Patient-Specific Factors:** It's essential to consider the patient's medical history, current medications, and potential interactions when selecting an antidepressant. In this case, the patient's constipation struggles may be exacerbated by certain medications, and a more suitable option should be chosen to minimize adverse effects.

## Query 29
My patient wants to use an AI app for thier depression, is this safe?

### Answer
This application is currently using the 2023 update of the CANMAT guidelines, published in 2024. At the time of its publication, digital health applications for direct-use by pateints had limited evidence. Applications should be assede for whether their techniques are evidence-based and evaluated on real-world populations. Other important factors include the privacy and security of the tool, the potential for providing harmful or inaccurate advice, and whether the patient may experience any barriers

## Response
* **Safety of AI Apps for Depression:** The use of AI apps for depression is still at an early stage, and there is currently insufficient evidence to recommend them for the treatment of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD).
* **Potential Risks:** There is a risk of inappropriate responses from AI systems, and the clinical application of chatbots is not well understood.
* **Evidence Quality:** The evidence for the use of chatbots in depression treatment is graded as low quality due to small sample sizes and high risk of bias (Level 3).
* **Recommendation:** Given the lack of evidence and potential risks, it is not recommended to rely solely on AI apps for the treatment of depression. Instead, patients should be encouraged to seek evidence-based treatments, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), under the guidance of a healthcare professional.
* **Reference:** [https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#section6E-07067437241245384](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#section6E-07067437241245384) and [https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#table1-07067437241245384](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#table1-07067437241245384)

## Query 30
How do I know if an antidepressant is working?

### Answer
The guidelines recommend the use of measurement-based care, which involves the routine use of validated outcome scales which are reviewed the pateints, and are used alongside clinical assesement to support collaborative decision-making. Examples of validated scales include patient-rated scales like the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), and clinican-rated scalces such as the Hamilton DEpression Rating Scale (HAM-D).

## Response
* **Determining if an Antidepressant is Working:**
    + Early improvement, often defined as a 20% or greater reduction in scores on a symptom rating scale within the first 4 weeks after starting an antidepressant, predicts a later response.
    + If early improvement is not seen by 4 weeks, there is only a low likelihood of response or remission at 8 to 12 weeks.
* **Action to Take if Antidepressant is Not Working:**
    + At that point, the decision should be to either increase the dose or to switch the antidepressant if there are tolerability concerns.
* **Reference:** [Reference 1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#section9D-07067437241245384) 

Note: The provided clinical guidelines context does not explicitly state how to know if an antidepressant is working, but it can be reasonably inferred from the section on early improvement and the decision to switch or increase the dose of an antidepressant.

## Query 31
When a patient is better, how long should they continue their antidepressant for?

### Answer
We recommend that antidepressents be maintained for 6 to 12 months after a patient achieves remission unless a patient has risk factors for the recurrence of depressive factors, in which case treatment should be continued for 2 years or more. These risk factors include residual symptoms, chronic depressive episodes, medical comorbidities, greater number of previous episodes, poor social support, or persistent stressful life events.

## Response
* **Recommended Duration for Antidepressant Treatment After Symptomatic Remission:**
  * Patients should continue medication treatment for a minimum of **6 to 12 months** after achieving symptomatic remission.
  * This recommendation is based on **Level 1 evidence**, which includes high-quality meta-analysis with narrow confidence intervals and/or 2 or more RCTs with adequate sample size.
* **Reasoning:**
  * The recommendation to continue antidepressant treatment for 6 to 12 months after remission is supported by new meta-regression evidence, which suggests that extending maintenance treatment for this duration adds benefit compared to stopping before 6 months.
  * The **2016 CANMAT guidelines** also recommend maintaining treatment with antidepressants for 6 to 9 months after achieving symptomatic remission, but the updated recommendation extends this duration to 6 to 12 months.
* **Reference:** 
  * [https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#section8B-07067437241245384](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#section8B-07067437241245384)

## Query 32
My patient has not responded to escitalopram at 10 mg, what should I do next?

### Answer
Assuming the dose is well tolerated, a first step could be to optimize the escitalopram dose to 20 mg.

## Response
### Next Steps for Patient Not Responding to Escitalopram

*   **Assess Patient's Response**: Evaluate the patient's response to escitalopram, considering factors such as dosage, duration of treatment, and adherence to the medication regimen.
*   **Consider Alternative Medications**: If the patient has not responded to escitalopram, consider alternative medications with evidence of superior response, such as:
    *   **Bupropion**: May be a suitable alternative, with a different mechanism of action and a favorable side effect profile.
    *   **Mirtazapine**: Another option with a distinct mechanism of action and a relatively low risk of adverse effects.
*   **Dose Adjustment**: If the patient is currently taking a low dose of escitalopram (10 mg), consider increasing the dose to the maximum recommended dose (20 mg) under close monitoring, as some patients may require higher doses to achieve a therapeutic response.
*   **Combination Therapy**: In some cases, combining escitalopram with another medication, such as bupropion or mirtazapine, may be considered to enhance treatment response.
*   **Monitor for Adverse Effects**: Regularly monitor the patient for adverse effects, particularly those associated with the selected medication, and adjust the treatment plan accordingly.

**Reference:** [https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#section5E-07067437241245384](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#section5E-07067437241245384) and [https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#section5J-07067437241245384](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#section5J-07067437241245384)

## Query 33
I am considering referring my patient to ECT for their depression. Would I need to stop their medications?

### Answer
Antidepressants and other medications can usually be continued during ECT treatment. A meta-analysis found that concurrent use of antidepressants during a course of ECT improved outcomes, but this was low-quality evidence based on older trials. Some concomitant medications may interfere with ECT efficacy (e.g., benzodiazepines and anticonvulsant medications) or worsen cognitive side effects (lithium and cannabis), and should be discontinued or held before ECT.

## Response
* **Medication Management Before ECT:** 
    + The provided clinical guidelines context does not explicitly state whether medications should be stopped before referring a patient to Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT) for their depression.
    + However, it can be inferred that the decision to stop or continue medications might depend on the specific patient's condition, the type of medications they are taking, and the potential interactions with ECT.
* **Considerations for ECT:**
    + ECT is recommended for severe cases of Major Depressive Episode (MDE) with high safety risk, especially in patients with psychotic features or those who are treatment-resistant (Level 1 and Level 3 evidence).
    + The benefits of ECT outweigh the risks among hospitalized Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) patients, with no evidence of increased risk of serious medical events.
* **Reference:** 
    + [https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#section10B1-07067437241245384](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#section10B1-07067437241245384)
    + [https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#section5A-07067437241245384](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#section5A-07067437241245384)
* **Conclusion:** 
    + No clear recommendation is found in the clinical guidelines regarding stopping medications before ECT.
    + It is essential to consult with a healthcare professional to determine the best course of action for each individual patient.
