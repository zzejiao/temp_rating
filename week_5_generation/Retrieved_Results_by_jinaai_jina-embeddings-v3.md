Question 2. What are the Principles for Depression Management? > Q.2.f. What Lifestyle Interventions are Effective? > paragraph id: 59

Different lifestyle factors have been implicated in the risk of both developing MDD (Major depressive disorder) and worsening symptom severity. For instance, insomnia can raise the likelihood of depressive episodes and is also a common residual symptom. Similarly, the relationship between cigarette smoking and depressive symptoms may be bidirectional, with individuals using smoking to alleviate depressive symptoms (self-medication) while smoking, in turn, may increase susceptibility to depressive symptoms. Lifestyle modifications such as exercise or an increase in physical activity, a healthier diet, smoking cessation, and sleep hygiene are beneficial in MDEs ( Table 2.4 ).

Question 2. What are the Principles for Depression Management? > Q.2.f. What Lifestyle Interventions are Effective? > paragraph id: 61

The CANMAT (Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments) 2016 guidelines noted substantial evidence for the efficacy of exercise as a treatment for MDD (Major depressive disorder) (Level 2) . While recognizing heterogeneity in RCT (Randomized controlled trial) methods, recent meta-analyses continue to show that adjunctive exercise is superior to no treatment and treatment as usual conditions in MDD (Major depressive disorder), with medium to large effects (Level 1) . Exercise can also reduce suicidal ideation and has good effects when combined with antidepressants. Meta-analyses show benefits in reducing depressive symptoms with the supervised aerobic activity of moderate to high intensity in adolescents and young adults, with low to moderate intensity exercise in midlife and older women, and with high-intensity interval training in adults. Exercise also provides positive health benefits beyond its effects on depression. Taken together, these findings continue to support the use of supervised exercise (i.e., low to moderate intensity, for 30 to 40 min at a time, 3 to 4 times a week, for a minimum of 9 weeks) as a first-line monotherapy for mild depression and a second-line adjunctive treatment for moderate severity illness (Level 1) (Table 2.4 and Table 3.7).

Question 3. How are Treatments Selected? > Q.3.a. How is the Initial Treatment Selected? > paragraph id: 72

For MDE (Major depressive episode) with mild severity and low safety risk (see Q.2c), evidence-based psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy have similar efficacy, but the balance of benefits and risks suggests a first-line psychotherapy, if readily accessible, as the preferred treatment. At this lower level of severity, monotherapy treatment with exercise, CAM (Complementary and alternative medicine) (Q.3.m) treatments and guided DHIs (Q.4.d) may be considered, especially when preferred by patients. Note that there is stronger evidence for efficacy and safety of pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy, compared to these treatments.

Question 3. How are Treatments Selected? > Q.3.g. How do DSM-5-TR Specifiers and Symptom Dimensions Influence Medication Selection? > paragraph id: 101

The 2016 CANMAT (Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments) guidelines also identified some symptom dimensions not included in DSM-5-TR that may have treatment specificity ( Table 3.6 ). Cognitive symptoms (problems with concentration, memory, and executive functioning) are common in MDD (Major depressive disorder) and medications such as vortioxetine, bupropion, and SNRIs may have superior efficacy for cognitive dysfunction compared to SSRIs (Level 2) . Recent meta-analyses support these findings. Duloxetine and other SNRIs show more benefits for comorbid pain conditions compared to SSRIs. Energy, fatigue, and motivation symptoms may preferentially respond to SNRIs compared to SSRIs (Level 2) .

Question 7. What Should be Done When a Patient is not Better? > Q.7.f. How is an Adjunctive Medication Selected? > paragraph id: 196

Selecting an adjunctive medication involves consideration of efficacy and tolerability, for both the adjunctive agent ( Table 7.2 ) and the continued antidepressant. The various adjunctive agents have very different side effect profiles and potential drug–drug interactions should also be considered. If pharmacogenetic test results are available, these may help in treatment selection, especially in DTD (Difficult-to-treat depression) (Level 3) . An often-used approach is to select an adjunctive medication which can address specific residual symptoms and/or side effects experienced by the patient (e.g., using a sedating medication when insomnia is present); there is, however, little evidence available to support this strategy. An important tip when considering adjunctive treatments is to minimize polypharmacy as much as possible by reassessing concurrent medications and discontinuing those with unclear benefits.

For MDE (Major depressive episode) of moderate severity with a low–moderate safety risk, the initial choice is between structured psychotherapy and antidepressant medication, the 2 treatment modalities with the most robust and consistent evidence for safety and efficacy (Level 1) . The choice between the two is less straightforward and depends on context, availability, and patient preference. Structured psychotherapies and first-line antidepressant medications are equally effective in treating MDD (Major depressive disorder) in the short term. Antidepressants may be slightly more efficacious in reducing symptoms of depressed mood, guilt, suicidal thoughts, anxiety, and somatic symptoms during the acute treatment phase, but structured psychotherapy (specifically, CBT (Cognitive-behavioural therapy)), is more efficacious than antidepressants at 6- to 12-month follow-up. The combination of antidepressant medication and psychotherapy should also be considered (Level 2) . Finally, exercise, certain CAM (Complementary and alternative medicine) treatments, and DHIs can also be used as adjunctive treatments to pharmacotherapy and/or psychotherapy, especially when preferred by the patient.

Table 3.1. Summary Recommendations for Selecting the Initial Treatment. [1]

The table presents a summary of recommendations for initial treatment selection based on the severity of Major Depressive Episode (MDE (Major depressive episode)) and the level of evidence supporting each recommendation. The table is divided into four sections, each representing a different level of evidence: Level 1, Level 2, Level 3, and Level 4.

**Mild with low safety risk.**

	* Psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy demonstrate similar benefits.
	* Psychotherapy (if readily accessible) is preferred because of fewer risks.
	* Exercise, certain CAM (Complementary and alternative medicine) treatments, or guided DHIIs may be considered as monotherapy, especially if preferred by patients.

**Moderate, with low-moderate safety risk.**

	* Initial choice is between pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy.
	* Pharmacotherapy is slightly more efficacious in reducing depressed mood, guilt, suicidal thoughts, anxiety, and somatic symptoms during acute treatment.
	* Structured psychotherapy, specifically CBT (Cognitive-behavioural therapy), is slightly more efficacious in the medium-term (6-12 months).
	* Combination of pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy may be considered.
	* Exercise, certain CAM (Complementary and alternative medicine) treatments and/or DHIIs may be considered as adjuncts to psychotherapy and/or pharmacotherapy, especially if preferred by patients.

**Severe, with moderate to high safety risk.**

	* For severe MDE (Major depressive episode) without psychotic symptoms, use a combination of pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy.
	* For severe MDE (Major depressive episode) with psychotic symptoms, use a combination of antidepressant and antipsychotic medication.
	* For very severe and/or life-threatening situations, consider electroconvulsive therapy.

Note. MDE (Major depressive episode) = major depressive episode; CAM (Complementary and alternative medicine) = complementary and alternative medicine; DHI (Digital health intervention) = digital health intervention; CBT (Cognitive-behavioural therapy) = cognitive-behavioural therapy. 
These recommendations are based on the severity of the illness (see conventions) and safety risk (see Q.2.c), but other factors should be considered, including treatment response in previous episodes, patient preference, and treatment availability.
There is stronger evidence for the efficacy and safety of pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy compared to exercise (Q.2.f), complementary and alternative medicine treatments (Q.3.m), and digital health interventions (Q.4.d).
[1] The level of evidence refers to the choice of treatment, not to the treatments themselves.

Acupuncture has also been studied in depression, with several meta-analyses showing the efficacy of acupuncture, as monotherapy and as an adjunct to antidepressants, versus all control conditions. However, a Cochrane review noted that, in comparisons of acupuncture with control/sham acupuncture conditions, the effect size was smaller than clinically relevant thresholds. There is insufficient evidence for its use in more severe illness. Hence, acupuncture is recommended as a second-line treatment for mild-severity MDD (Major depressive disorder), and as a second-line adjunctive treatment for moderate-severity MDD (Major depressive disorder) (Level 2) ( Table 3.7 ).

Question 3. How are Treatments Selected? > Q.3.m. What Complementary and Alternative Medicine Treatments are Effective? > paragraph id: 119

CAM (Complementary and alternative medicine) treatments are increasingly used to manage depression. Here we provide recommendations for using the CAM (Complementary and alternative medicine) treatments that have the best quality evidence, focusing on new data since the CANMAT (Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments) 2016 guidelines (see Sarris et al., 2022, for practical guidance/dosage information). To date, no CAM (Complementary and alternative medicine) treatment has reached the level of evidence that would make it comparable to a first-line psychotherapy or pharmacotherapy treatment for moderate to severe depression. There is also inconsistency in the therapeutic dose ranges of most CAM (Complementary and alternative medicine) treatments. CANMAT (Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments) therefore recommends the consideration of CAM (Complementary and alternative medicine) treatments alone only for MDE (Major depressive episode) of mild severity (see Q.3.a), whereas CAM (Complementary and alternative medicine) treatments may be used as adjuncts to standard treatments in moderate severity illness.

Other herbs such as Crocus sativus (saffron), Lavandula (lavender), and Rhodiola (roseroot) have only modest evidence for benefit in MDE (Major depressive episode). A meta-analysis found the efficacy of saffron for reducing depressive symptoms when compared to placebo and as an adjunct to antidepressants. Another meta-analysis on the efficacy of lavender reported a reduction in depressive symptoms compared to control conditions. However, given the modest benefit and the major limitations of the RCTs, saffron, lavender, and roseroot continue to be recommended as third-line treatments in mild illness (Level 3) ( Table 3.7 ).

Question 3. How are Treatments Selected? > Q.3.a. How is the Initial Treatment Selected? > paragraph id: 70

The choice of initial treatment for MDD (Major depressive disorder) is an important and consequential decision that should be made collaboratively between clinician and patient. Information sharing should include the range of potential treatments, the evidence supporting each, the nature and severity of depression, and the personal situation, expectations, and preferences of the patient. CANMAT (Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments) recommendations are based primarily on the severity of depression (see Conventions section for definitions of mild, moderate, and severe), but other factors, including treatment response in past episodes, patient preference and treatment availability, should also be considered ( Table 3.1 ).

Methods > Conventions Used in This Document > paragraph id: 22

While various terms are used for lived experience, in these guidelines, the term patient refers to individuals with MDD (Major depressive disorder) in clinical treatment. We use the terms mild , moderate , and severe to describe the severity of a major depressive episode (MDE (Major depressive episode)), based on the rating of symptom severity and degree of functional impairment, whichever is higher. We recommend the use of a validated rating scale to quantify these (see Q.5.a). As an example, an MDE (Major depressive episode) of moderate severity could represent either moderately severe symptoms with mild–moderate functional impairment, or mild–moderate symptom severity with moderate impairment.

In severe cases of MDE (Major depressive episode) with high safety risk and without psychotic features, CANMAT (Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments) recommends the combination of antidepressant medication and psychotherapy, either started at the same time or in a staggered fashion as planned sequential treatment (Level 2) (see Q.3.b). For severe MDE (Major depressive episode) with psychotic symptoms, the combination of an antidepressant and an atypical antipsychotic (serotonin-dopamine activity modulator) is recommended; structured psychotherapy should not be considered until psychotic symptoms subside (Level 1) . In the most severe MDEs and/or in life-threatening situations (e.g., severe suicide risk and physical deterioration), electroconvulsive therapy (ECT (Electroconvulsive therapy)) should be considered as the first-choice option (Level 3) .

Optimizing the antidepressant dose is an important first step. Higher than minimal therapeutic doses are more effective (to a plateau around the equivalent of 50 mg of fluoxetine) but less well-tolerated (Level 1) .

For first-treatment patients, the remission rates are higher, but almost half will not achieve remission with antidepressants after 6 months of treatment. Hence, inadequate response to treatment is a common clinical challenge.

For these medication strategies, a comprehensive review of previous medication trials, major side effects experienced, and whether there is a partial response, can inform the decision. Switching should be considered first when there is no response to the initial antidepressant or when the first medication has troublesome side effects. Adjunctive strategies should be considered first when there is a partial response to the initial antidepressant and there are minimal or no tolerability issues with the first medication.

Question 7. What Should be Done When a Patient is not Better? > Q.7.a. What Contributes to a Poor Response to Treatment? > paragraph id: 180

In real-world populations, approximately half of patients with MDD (Major depressive disorder) achieve response (>50% reduction in symptom severity) after 8 weeks of antidepressant monotherapy, while about a third attain full symptom remission; only a quarter of nonremitters who receive a second pharmacological treatment will reach remission. For first-treatment patients, the remission rates are higher, but almost half will not achieve remission with antidepressants after 6 months of treatment. Hence, inadequate response to treatment is a common clinical challenge.

Question 7. What Should be Done When a Patient is not Better? > Q.7.c. How are Strategies Sequenced When There is a Poor Response to an Initial Antidepressant Treatment? > paragraph id: 187

Optimizing the antidepressant dose is an important first step. Higher than minimal therapeutic doses are more effective (to a plateau around the equivalent of 50 mg of fluoxetine) but less well-tolerated (Level 1) . Hence, increasing the dose for nonresponse must be balanced against increasing side effect burden and poorer adherence.

For these medication strategies, a comprehensive review of previous medication trials, major side effects experienced, and whether there is a partial response, can inform the decision. Switching should be considered first when there is no response to the initial antidepressant or when the first medication has troublesome side effects. Adjunctive strategies should be considered first when there is a partial response to the initial antidepressant and there are minimal or no tolerability issues with the first medication.

Question 7. What Should be Done When a Patient is not Better? > Q.7.f. How is an Adjunctive Medication Selected? > paragraph id: 196

Selecting an adjunctive medication involves consideration of efficacy and tolerability, for both the adjunctive agent ( Table 7.2 ) and the continued antidepressant. The various adjunctive agents have very different side effect profiles and potential drug–drug interactions should also be considered. If pharmacogenetic test results are available, these may help in treatment selection, especially in DTD (Difficult-to-treat depression) (Level 3) . An often-used approach is to select an adjunctive medication which can address specific residual symptoms and/or side effects experienced by the patient (e.g., using a sedating medication when insomnia is present); there is, however, little evidence available to support this strategy. An important tip when considering adjunctive treatments is to minimize polypharmacy as much as possible by reassessing concurrent medications and discontinuing those with unclear benefits.

Question 7. What Should be Done When a Patient is not Better? > Q.7.e. What are the Benefits and Drawbacks of Adding an Adjunctive Medication? > paragraph id: 194

Adding an adjunctive agent retains partial treatment gains from the initial antidepressant, avoids discontinuation symptoms from stopping the first medication, and potentially adds complementary mechanisms of action that have a faster onset of response. These benefits are especially helpful when there has been a partial response to the first antidepressant, and it is well tolerated. Adding another medication may also target specific residual symptoms or side effects from the initial antidepressant.

Question 6. What Should be Done When a Patient is Better? > Q.6.d. How Should Antidepressant Treatment be Discontinued? > paragraph id: 175

Up to 50% of patients may experience discontinuation symptoms when stopping long-term use of antidepressants, especially with abrupt stopping. Discontinuation symptoms may include flu-like symptoms, insomnia, nausea, imbalance, sensory disturbances, and hyperarousal (the FINISH mnemonic). These emergent symptoms generally occur within a few days after a decrease in dose or stopping the antidepressant, are mild to moderate in severity, and resolve within a few weeks. However, later onset, greater severity, and longer duration of symptoms lasting several months or longer have been reported (see Box 6.1 ). Antidepressants with a shorter half-life, such as paroxetine and venlafaxine, are associated with a greater incidence/severity and a quicker onset of discontinuation symptoms. Table 6.3 shows the risk of discontinuation symptoms for various antidepressants.

Question 6. What Should be Done When a Patient is Better? > Q.6.d. How Should Antidepressant Treatment be Discontinued? > paragraph id: 177

It is important to differentiate discontinuation symptoms from early symptoms of recurrence since misdiagnosing these emergent symptoms can prolong antidepressant use unnecessarily. Discontinuation symptoms generally have an earlier onset (within days rather than weeks), are often characterized by somatic symptoms (e.g., nausea, dizziness, and shock-like sensations) that differ from those of the initial depressive episode, and improve rapidly if the dose is restored to its previous level. Although gradual tapering of antidepressants may not prevent discontinuation symptoms, they typically occur less frequently compared to abrupt stopping and are less severe. Psychological support may also help with antidepressant discontinuation. Adding psychotherapy may allow patients to stop medication without increasing the risk of relapse and may help mitigate discontinuation symptoms while tapering the antidepressant.

Question 6. What Should be Done When a Patient is Better? > Q.6.d. How Should Antidepressant Treatment be Discontinued? > Box 6.1. > paragraph id: 176

Protracted Discontinuation Symptoms and Hyperbolic Tapering Schedules.
Persistent discontinuation syndromes, with severe, potentially irreversible symptoms persisting beyond 6 weeks, have been described after stopping long-term antidepressant treatment. However, differing rates in the literature suggest that these discontinuation syndromes are heterogeneous, often occur with overlapping conditions, and require individual attention and assessment. In addition, since protracted discontinuation symptoms have mostly been reported in case reports, user surveys and internet forums, more rigorous studies are needed to establish their frequency, severity, and risk.
It has been suggested that, at the lower end of the therapeutic dose range, linear dose reduction may still result in a disproportionately large reduction in serotonin transporter inhibition, which may contribute to severe withdrawal symptoms. As a result, instead of decreasing the dose by a fixed amount (e.g., 10 mg), a “hyperbolic dose reduction” approach has been proposed, which targets a fixed percentage (e.g., 10%) reduction in serotonin receptor occupancy with each dose decrease. However, this approach is extrapolated from receptor studies using positron emission tomography (PET) in small numbers of participants and has not been evaluated in RCTs. The dosing schedule also presents a challenge in clinical practice, as it relies on compounding pharmacies to prepare liquid formulations or encapsulated nonstandard doses of antidepressants to achieve the required low doses. Hence, there is insufficient evidence to recommend hyperbolic tapering schedules.

Question 3. How are Treatments Selected? > Q.3.h. Are Antidepressants Associated With an Increased Risk of Suicide? > paragraph id: 105

In summary, the initial few weeks before and after starting any treatment is a higher risk period for suicide. While antidepressants generally reduce suicidal ideation, a small proportion of patients may experience increased suicidal ideation when initiating antidepressants, especially young people. CANMAT (Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments) recommends routine monitoring of suicide risk for all patients during antidepressant treatment, with enhanced attention during the first 4 weeks following a new antidepressant prescription and after stopping the medication (Level 3) . With adolescent and young adult patients, in particular, clinicians should ensure that they are aware of the risk of increased suicidal thoughts and behaviours before initiating an antidepressant. Clinicians also should educate patients that if they experience an increase in suicidal thoughts when starting a new medication, they should (a) understand them as a medication side effect; (b) be aware that increasing suicidal thoughts indicate a need for urgent action to address distress and other symptoms; (c) implement a safety plan (see Q.2.c); and (d) reach out to their care provider, crisis line (e.g., call 9-8-8 in Canada and the USA (United States of America)), or an emergency department (Level 4) .

Question 6. What Should be Done When a Patient is Better? > Q.6.b. How is Recurrence Prevented? > paragraph id: 168

Once patients achieve symptom remission, maintenance pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy are both effective strategies for preventing a depressive recurrence ( Table 6.1 ). Maintenance medication treatment can reduce relapse rates by 50% compared to placebo, and flexible dose adjustments are more effective than fixed doses. In recent, large-sample RCTs examining maintaining or discontinuing antidepressants in stably treated patients, medication maintenance was associated with lower rates of recurrence during 1-year and 3-year follow-up, whether or not patients had CBT (Cognitive-behavioural therapy) during acute treatment (Level 1) .

Question 6. What Should be Done When a Patient is Better? > Q.6.b. How is Recurrence Prevented? > paragraph id: 170

The 2016 CANMAT (Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments) guidelines recommended that patients maintain treatment with antidepressants for 6 to 9 months after achieving symptomatic remission. New meta-regression evidence suggests that extending maintenance treatment for 6 to 12 months after remission adds benefit compared to stopping before 6 months (Level 1) . Hence, the recommendation has been adjusted to maintain antidepressants for 6 to 12 months after remission ( Table 6.1 ).

Question 6. What Should be Done When a Patient is Better? > Q.6.c. Who Needs Longer-Term Antidepressant Treatment? > paragraph id: 173

While 6 to 12 months of maintenance antidepressant treatment is recommended for all patients, some will require longer-term maintenance because they have risk factors for recurrence and chronicity ( Table 6.2 ). Most risk factors are longitudinal and part of a continuum of exposure to depression and other psychological stressors throughout the lifespan. A systematic meta-review identified residual symptoms and a history of maltreatment or abuse during childhood as robust risk factors for recurrence. Other risk factors, including longer episode duration and greater severity of depressive episodes, have less evidence to support a higher risk of recurrence. Some evidence suggests that prior depressive episodes and residual symptoms could indicate a kindling effect, in which subsequent depressive episodes are triggered by milder stressors, and whereby certain individual characteristics such as early childhood adversity and neuroticism may contribute to a heightened sensitivity to life stressors over time.

Table 6.1. Summary Recommendations for Maintenance Antidepressant Treatment.

The table presents a summary of recommendations for the treatment of depression, categorized into four levels of evidence. The first line of treatment is divided into two columns: "Line of treatment" and "Level of evidence." The "Line of treatment" column lists the recommendations, while the "Level of evidence" column indicates the level of evidence supporting each recommendation.

The first line of treatment includes the following recommendations:

*   For patients who have achieved symptom remission, using maintenance pharmacotherapy and/or psychotherapy can prevent recurrence.
	*   **Level of evidence**: Level 1

*   All patients treated with antidepressants should continue medication treatment for a minimum of 6 to 12 months after achieving symptomatic remission.
	*   **Level of evidence**: Level 1

*   Patients with risk factors for recurrence (see Table 6.2) should continue antidepressant treatment for 2 years or more.
	*   **Level of evidence**: Level 3

*   Patients with recurrent and severe MDEs should use sequential treatment (adding psychotherapy after stabilizing on medications) to prevent recurrence.
	*   **Level of evidence**: Level 1

*   When a decision is made to stop the antidepressant, it should be tapered gradually, whenever possible, for several weeks or months with more time between dose reductions near the end of the taper.
	*   **Level of evidence**: Level 3

*   For patients treated with medication for less than 4 weeks, the antidepressant can be tapered and discontinued quickly, over 2 weeks or less.
	*   **Level of evidence**: Level 3

*   Psychological treatments can be added before or during antidepressant discontinuation to help patients stop the antidepressant.
	*   **Level of evidence**: Level 2

Question 6. What Should be Done When a Patient is Better? > Q.6.b. How is Recurrence Prevented? > paragraph id: 168

Once patients achieve symptom remission, maintenance pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy are both effective strategies for preventing a depressive recurrence ( Table 6.1 ). Maintenance medication treatment can reduce relapse rates by 50% compared to placebo, and flexible dose adjustments are more effective than fixed doses. In recent, large-sample RCTs examining maintaining or discontinuing antidepressants in stably treated patients, medication maintenance was associated with lower rates of recurrence during 1-year and 3-year follow-up, whether or not patients had CBT (Cognitive-behavioural therapy) during acute treatment (Level 1) .

Question 6. What Should be Done When a Patient is Better? > Q.6.a. How is Remission Maintained? > paragraph id: 166

Maintaining remission is an important goal, as the risk of recurrence increases with each subsequent depressive episode. For psychological treatments, booster sessions may be helpful to retain and encourage strategies to maintain remission. Similarly, optimizing pharmacotherapy and treatment adherence will help individuals stay well. This can be done by maintaining the lowest effective dose used to achieve remission and minimize side effects, and regularly monitoring for emerging symptoms and side effects using MBC (Measurement-based care).

Table 6.1. Summary Recommendations for Maintenance Antidepressant Treatment.

The table presents a summary of recommendations for the treatment of depression, categorized into four levels of evidence. The first line of treatment is divided into two columns: "Line of treatment" and "Level of evidence." The "Line of treatment" column lists the recommendations, while the "Level of evidence" column indicates the level of evidence supporting each recommendation.

The first line of treatment includes the following recommendations:

*   For patients who have achieved symptom remission, using maintenance pharmacotherapy and/or psychotherapy can prevent recurrence.
	*   **Level of evidence**: Level 1

*   All patients treated with antidepressants should continue medication treatment for a minimum of 6 to 12 months after achieving symptomatic remission.
	*   **Level of evidence**: Level 1

*   Patients with risk factors for recurrence (see Table 6.2) should continue antidepressant treatment for 2 years or more.
	*   **Level of evidence**: Level 3

*   Patients with recurrent and severe MDEs should use sequential treatment (adding psychotherapy after stabilizing on medications) to prevent recurrence.
	*   **Level of evidence**: Level 1

*   When a decision is made to stop the antidepressant, it should be tapered gradually, whenever possible, for several weeks or months with more time between dose reductions near the end of the taper.
	*   **Level of evidence**: Level 3

*   For patients treated with medication for less than 4 weeks, the antidepressant can be tapered and discontinued quickly, over 2 weeks or less.
	*   **Level of evidence**: Level 3

*   Psychological treatments can be added before or during antidepressant discontinuation to help patients stop the antidepressant.
	*   **Level of evidence**: Level 2

Note. MDE (Major depressive episode) = major disorder episode

Question 5. How is Treatment Monitored? > Q.5.d. What Laboratory Tests Should be Monitored During Treatment? > paragraph id: 164

Routine laboratory tests are not necessary to monitor antidepressant treatment for MDD (Major depressive disorder) ( Table 5.1 ), although some blood tests are indicated in specific clinical situations 7. For instance, liver function tests should be done at baseline and every 6 to 12 months in patients with pre-existing liver diseases, and serum electrolyte monitoring should be considered for older patients (age 60 years and older) as they are more susceptible to hyponatremia with antidepressants (Level 4) . Moreover, when adjunctive agents (e.g., lithium, atypical antipsychotics, and ketamine) are used, lab tests tailored to the specific medication should be monitored. For example, patients taking lithium should have blood tests (lithium levels, electrolytes, calcium, creatinine, eGFR, and TSH) checked at baseline and every 6 to 12 months thereafter, or whenever the clinical status or lithium dose changes. For those on longer-term ketamine/esketamine treatment, periodic urinalysis is recommended to check for cystitis, a potential long-term side effect of ketamine use.

Question 5. How is Treatment Monitored? > Q.5.d. What Laboratory Tests Should be Monitored During Treatment? > paragraph id: 165

Weight gain is associated with MDD (Major depressive disorder) both as a symptom of illness and as a medication side effect. Therefore, regular monitoring of weight, glucose, and lipid profiles is recommended in patients taking medications associated with weight gain, according to obesity management guidelines (Level 3) .

Question 3. How are Treatments Selected? > Q.3.j. What are the Safety Concerns and Drug Interactions With Antidepressants? > paragraph id: 111

A rare but serious adverse effect of several antidepressants is drug-induced liver injury, which can occur up to 6 months after initiating the medication. Agomelatine, bupropion, duloxetine, and nefazodone are associated with a higher risk of adverse liver effects, while citalopram and escitalopram have a lower risk. Mirtazapine has an excellent short-term safety profile but is associated with significant increases in appetite, weight gain, and long-term metabolic risks.

Table 3.5 also summarizes comparative ratings for side effects of particular importance to patients (sedation, weight gain, and sexual dysfunction) alongside a category of other tolerability (side effects other than those 3). For sedation and weight gain, results from longer-term observational studies are included in the comparative assessment. Of note is that some treatment-emergent weight gain may be normative, e.g., in patients whose depressive symptoms include weight loss. Treatment-emergent sexual dysfunction, which can affect all phases of sexual response (desire, arousal, and orgasm) is also commonly experienced with antidepressants, particularly in those with serotonergic effects. Based on studies where sexual dysfunction is systematically assessed, several antidepressants (desvenlafaxine, bupropion, mirtazapine, vilazodone, vortioxetine, and agomelatine) are associated with lower rates of sexual side effects. Because sexual dysfunction can also be a symptom of depression, an assessment of baseline sexual functioning is important to identify emergent sexual side effects.

The combination of antidepressant medication and psychotherapy should also be considered (Level 2) . Finally, exercise, certain CAM (Complementary and alternative medicine) treatments, and DHIs can also be used as adjunctive treatments to pharmacotherapy and/or psychotherapy, especially when preferred by the patient.

At this lower level of severity, monotherapy treatment with exercise, CAM (Complementary and alternative medicine) (Q.3.m) treatments and guided DHIs (Q.4.d) may be considered, especially when preferred by patients. Note that there is stronger evidence for efficacy and safety of pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy, compared to these treatments.

Question 3. How are Treatments Selected? > Q.3.e. How is a Pharmacological Treatment Selected? > Table 3.5. > paragraph id: 88

Table 3.5.

The table presents a comprehensive comparison of various antidepressants across different aspects, which are grouped into two categories:

1. efficacy and drug-specific issues (including efficacy, acceptability [1], drug interactions, and 
2. discontinuation) and tolerability issues (including sedation, weight gain, sexual dysfunction, and other tolerability issues[2]).

The data is organized into rows representing individual antidepressants and columns representing specific performance aspects.

*   **SSRIs**
    *   Citalopram: More favourable in acceptability, drug interactions (QTc [3]), sedation, less favourable in sexual dysfunction, neutral in efficacy, discontinuation, weight gain, other tolerability issues.
    *   Escitalopram: More favorable in efficacy, acceptability, drug interactions, sedation, weight gain, other tolerability, less favorable in sexual dysfunction, neutral in discontinuation.
    *   Fluoxetine: More favorable in acceptability, discontinuation, sedation, weight gian, other tolerability issues, less favorable in drug interactions, sexual dysfunction, neutral in efficacy.
    *   Fluvoxamine: More favorable in sedation, weight gain, less favorable in drug interactions, secual dysfunction, neutral in efficacy, acceptability, discontinuation, other tolerability issues.
    *   Paroxetine: More favorable in efficacy, less favorable in drug interactions, discontinuation, weight gain, sexual dysfunction, neutral in acceptability, sedation, other tolerability issues.
    *   Sertraline: More favorable in efficacy, acceptability, sedation, other tolerability issues, neutral in drug interactions, discontinuation, sedation, weight gain, sexual dysfunction.
*   **SNRIs**
    *   Desvenlafaxine: More favorable in drug interactions, sedation, weight gain, sexual dysfunction, and other tolerability issues, neutral in efficacy, acceptability, discontinuation.
    *   Duloxetine: More favorable in sedation, less favorable in sexual dysfunction, neutral in efficacy, acceptability, drug interactions, discontinuation, weight gain, other tolerability issues.
    *   Levomilnacipran: More favorable in drug interactions, sedation, weight gain, neutral in efficacy, acceptability, discontinuation, sexual dysfunction, and other tolerability issues.
    *   Venlafaxine-XR: More favorable in efficacy, sedation, less favorable in discontinuation, sexual dysfunction, other tolerability issues, neutral in acceptability, drug interactions, weight gain.
*   **Others**
    *   Bupropion: More favorable in efficacy, discontinuation, sedation, weight gain, sexual dysfunction, other tolerability issues,  neutral in acceptability, drug interactions.
    *   Mirtazapine: More favorable in efficacy, acceptability, drug interactions, discontinuation, sexual dysfunction, less favorable in sedation, weight gain.
    *   Vilazodone: More favorable in drug interactions, sedation, weight gain, sexual dysfunction, other tolerability issues, neutral in efficacy, acceptability, discontinuation.
    *   Vortioxetine: More favorable in efficacy, acceptability, drug interactions, discontinuation, sedation, weight gain, sexual dysfunction, neutral other tolerability issues.
*   **Not available in Canada**
    *   Agomelatine: More favorable in efficacy, acceptability, drug interactions (LFTs [4]), discontinuation, weight gain, sexual dysfunction, other tolerability issues, neutral in sedation.
    *   Mianserin: More favorable in drug interactions, other issue tolerability issues, less favorable in sedation, neutral in efficacy, acceptability, discontinuation, weight gain, sexual dysfunction.
    *   Milnacipran: More favorable in drug interactions, sedation, neutral in efficacy, acceptability, discontinuation, weight gain, sexual dysfunction, other tolerability issues.

Note. These comparative favourability ratings are based on a variety of data sources, including meta-analyses and RCTs, supplemented with expert consensus. 
	Note that ratings show those agents that have more favourable profiles (in green squares) and those with less favourable profiles (in red squares).
	These are not absolute ratings; an agent can be impeded for other clinical reasons despite having a rating as less favourable in a particular characteristic.
	Clear squares indicate neutral ratings and do not imply intermediate favourability.
[1] Efficacy refers to response rates in meta-analyses; Acceptability refers to all-cause discontinuation rates in meta-analyses; Drug Interactions include clinically significant interactions (see Q3.1); Discontinuation refers to potential for discontinuation effects (see Q6.4); 
[2] Other Tolerability refers to side effects other than sedation, weight gain, and sexual dysfunction; 
[3] QTc, indicates recommended monitoring for prolongation of QTc interval; 
[4] LFTs, indicates recommended monitoring of liver function tests (see Q3.1).

Question 7. What Should be Done When a Patient is not Better? > Q.7.c. How are Strategies Sequenced When There is a Poor Response to an Initial Antidepressant Treatment? > paragraph id: 190

For these medication strategies, a comprehensive review of previous medication trials, major side effects experienced, and whether there is a partial response, can inform the decision. Switching should be considered first when there is no response to the initial antidepressant or when the first medication has troublesome side effects. Adjunctive strategies should be considered first when there is a partial response to the initial antidepressant and there are minimal or no tolerability issues with the first medication.

Question 7. What Should be Done When a Patient is not Better? > Q.7.c. How are Strategies Sequenced When There is a Poor Response to an Initial Antidepressant Treatment? > paragraph id: 188

After optimizing the dose, the main medication options involve switching to another antidepressant or adding an adjunctive medication. The evidence for the efficacy of switching antidepressants is inconsistent. Meta-analyses show that switching to another antidepressant is not superior to continuing the same one (Level 2) and there appears to be diminishing response rates for antidepressant monotherapy beyond the first switch.

Question 3. How are Treatments Selected? > Q.3.g. How do DSM-5-TR Specifiers and Symptom Dimensions Influence Medication Selection? > paragraph id: 101

The 2016 CANMAT (Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments) guidelines also identified some symptom dimensions not included in DSM-5-TR that may have treatment specificity ( Table 3.6 ). Cognitive symptoms (problems with concentration, memory, and executive functioning) are common in MDD (Major depressive disorder) and medications such as vortioxetine, bupropion, and SNRIs may have superior efficacy for cognitive dysfunction compared to SSRIs (Level 2) . Recent meta-analyses support these findings. Duloxetine and other SNRIs show more benefits for comorbid pain conditions compared to SSRIs. Energy, fatigue, and motivation symptoms may preferentially respond to SNRIs compared to SSRIs (Level 2) .

Question 4. What is the Role of DHIs? > Q.4.b. What are Best Practices for Evaluating DHIs? > paragraph id: 136

Data privacy and security are paramount for DHIs, but many have unclear or inaccurate privacy/security policies, and data are often shared with or sold to third parties. DHIs are more likely to be trustworthy if they have a clear privacy policy, guarantee to keep data anonymous, offer data security measures including password protection, explicitly state they will not sell data to third parties, and allow users to delete or opt out of data collection entirely. Other privacy risks should also be considered, e.g., risk of unwanted disclosure if a mobile app has a diagnosis in its title. Clinicians should also consult their regulatory bodies for up-to-date guidance on the evaluation and use of DHIs.

Question 4. What is the Role of DHIs? > Q.4.b. What are Best Practices for Evaluating DHIs? > paragraph id: 138

Access, cost, and ease of use are also important aspects, particularly for users with disabilities or language/literacy issues. While up-front costs for many DHIs may be low, some have additional costs such as subscriptions for extra features or therapist guidance. Disengagement is commonly experienced during a depressive episode, hence, normalizing and expecting this can reduce shame and allow conversations with patients about compensatory strategies. Clinicians can also ask patients about the current use of other apps to identify features which may support DHI (Digital health intervention) use (e.g., gamification, notifications, and social networking integration). Sharing data with a health care provider or a trusted support may also help the user make sense of changes in mood states over time, as well as detect any adverse events.

* Carry a high index of suspicion for MDD (Major depressive disorder) in individuals with exposure to static nonmodifiable risk factors and dynamic, potentially modifiable risk factors (Level 4).
* Screen for depression using a validated scale (e.g., PHQ (Patient health questionnaire)-2 followed by the PHQ (Patient health questionnaire)-9) in individuals with risk factors for depression, when there are supports and resources in place to follow up with full diagnostic assessment and treatment (Level 2).
* Conduct a comprehensive diagnostic assessment that addresses biological, psychological, and social factors while recognizing ethnocultural diversity, within a longitudinal life-course framework (Level 4).
* For equity-deserving groups in particular, use screening, culturally competent care, collaborative care, and digital health interventions to improve access to and quality of mental health care (Level 4).

Many individuals with depression are interested in using DHIs to support their mental health care but they often face challenges when looking for evidence-informed, engaging, and safe DHIs. Commercially available DHIs for depression are often promoted by internet or app store search algorithms, which prioritize popularity and often fail to disclose criteria for efficacy, safety, privacy, and security of personal health information. Positive user reviews may contain anecdotal evidence of utility, but they do not necessarily correlate with expert evaluation. While DHIs developed by academic researchers may be free of commercial bias and have a more robust evidence base, they are seldom publicly available.

## Query 26
What are r isk factors for depression?

### Answer
There are numerous risk factors for major depressive disorder. These include family history, history of adverse childhood expereinces, comorbid medical ilnesses, comorbid substance use. There are also social and enviromental risk factors, such as stressful life events, job strain, income inequlity, bulling, sedentary life style, and working night shifts.

Stressful life events and circumstances, including interpersonal stress, job strain and insecurity, income inequality, and challenging living environment, are associated with an increased risk of developing MDD (Major depressive disorder) even when correcting for pre-existing depressive symptoms and comorbid other medical conditions. Bereavement is a normal process, but severe or prolonged grief also can increase the risk of an MDE (Major depressive episode). Other modifiable factors associated with a greater risk of MDD (Major depressive disorder) include a sedentary lifestyle, increased screen time watching television or using mobile devices, and shift work.

Question 1. What are Important Issues for Assessment and Diagnosis? > Q.1.a. What are the Risk Factors for MDD (Major depressive disorder)? > paragraph id: 26

Numerous risk factors for MDD (Major depressive disorder) have been identified, with varying strength of evidence ( Table 1.1 ). Some are static and nonmodifiable historical factors such as a family history of depression and a history of adverse childhood experiences. Others are dynamic in that they may emerge and recede through the life span, such as psychiatric and nonpsychiatric medical illness, interpersonal or occupational stress, and bereavement. Clinicians should be aware of both static and dynamic factors to better address the full range of biological, psychological and social issues in case management ( Table 1.2 ).

Many nonpsychiatric medical conditions, including chronic pain, cardiovascular illness, cancer, inflammatory bowel diseases, diabetes mellitus, sleep disorders, obesity, and acne, are associated with increased risk for MDD (Major depressive disorder), with most conditions having a bidirectional relationship. Periods of hormonal changes in women, e.g., perinatal and perimenopausal periods, are also high-risk times for MDD (Major depressive disorder).

Table 1.2. Recommendations[*] for Screening and Assessment

Summary recommendations for screening and assessment

* Carry a high index of suspicion for MDD (Major depressive disorder) in individuals with exposure to static nonmodifiable risk factors and dynamic, potentially modifiable risk factors (Level 4).
* Screen for depression using a validated scale (e.g., PHQ (Patient health questionnaire)-2 followed by the PHQ (Patient health questionnaire)-9) in individuals with risk factors for depression, when there are supports and resources in place to follow up with full diagnostic assessment and treatment (Level 2).
* Conduct a comprehensive diagnostic assessment that addresses biological, psychological, and social factors while recognizing ethnocultural diversity, within a longitudinal life-course framework (Level 4).
* For equity-deserving groups in particular, use screening, culturally competent care, collaborative care, and digital health interventions to improve access to and quality of mental health care (Level 4).

[*]Recommendations for principles of care are generally based on Level 3 and Level 4 evidence. 
Note. MDD (Major depressive disorder) = major depressive disorder; PHQ (Patient health questionnaire) = Patient Health Questionnaire.

Question 3. How are Treatments Selected? > Q.3.b. When Should Pharmacotherapy and Psychotherapy be Combined? > paragraph id: 75

Combining psychological treatment with pharmacotherapy is more effective than either alone for acute treatment; combined treatment also is associated with a reduced risk of recurrence. The strongest evidence supports in-person CBT (Cognitive-behavioural therapy) (including mindfulness-based cognitive therapy [MBCT (Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy)]) initiated sequentially after treatment with an antidepressant is established (Level 1) . Psychological treatments may also address residual symptoms of depression that remain after pharmacotherapy treatment. A smaller body of evidence supports adding psychodynamic psychotherapy to an antidepressant (Level 3) . Adding psychological treatment is effective whether the antidepressant is continued or not, but the highest chances of sustained recovery are seen when an antidepressant is continued with added psychological treatment (Level 2) . Hence, for patients with mild or moderate severity episodes treated with sequential psychotherapy, the risks and benefits of continuing or tapering medications should be considered (see Q.6.d).

Question 3. How are Treatments Selected? > Q.3.b. When Should Pharmacotherapy and Psychotherapy be Combined? > paragraph id: 76

Planned sequential treatment (adding psychotherapy after initial response to pharmacotherapy) may be especially useful for individuals with recurrent and severe forms of depression who carry a high risk of relapse following a monotherapy treatment (Level 2) (see Q.6.b). In these cases, pharmacotherapy should be continued during psychological treatment.

The frequency of treatment sessions is also related to patient benefit, with increased frequency of psychological treatment sessions producing better outcomes.

There is little support for the efficacy of psychological treatment delivered less than once per week.

A rare but serious adverse effect of several antidepressants is drug-induced liver injury, which can occur up to 6 months after initiating the medication. Agomelatine, bupropion, duloxetine, and nefazodone are associated with a higher risk of adverse liver effects, while citalopram and escitalopram have a lower risk. Mirtazapine has an excellent short-term safety profile but is associated with significant increases in appetite, weight gain, and long-term metabolic risks.

Question 3. How are Treatments Selected? > Q.3.j. What are the Safety Concerns and Drug Interactions With Antidepressants? > paragraph id: 110

SSRIs are associated with a modest increased risk of fractures and falls, particularly in older adults. Most SSRIs have few clinically relevant effects on CYP (Cytochrome P450) isoenzymes and have low risk for drug interactions. Exceptions are fluoxetine and paroxetine, which are potent inhibitors of CYP2D6, and fluvoxamine, which is a potent inhibitor of CYP1A2, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4. These antidepressants can increase blood levels of concurrent medications that are substrates of these CYP450 isoenzymes. Combining SSRIs with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs; e.g., ibuprofen) is associated with an increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, which is mitigated with the use of proton pump inhibitors. In addition, concurrent use of SSRIs with diuretics (e.g., hydrochlorothiazide) is associated with an increased risk of hyponatremia, especially in older adults. Mianserin and agomelatine (both not available in Canada or the USA (United States of America)) are the only antidepressants not associated with hyponatremia 7. SNRIs can cause increases in blood pressure and share the risk of interactions with NSAIDs and diuretics noted for SSRIs.

Question 3. How are Treatments Selected? > Q.3.e. How is a Pharmacological Treatment Selected? > paragraph id: 93

In addition to efficacy and tolerability, patient and clinical factors may also be considered in selecting antidepressant medication in some cases, including episode specifiers and symptom dimensions (see Q.3.g). While most antidepressants appear to be effective irrespective of sex, gender, race, ethnicity, and baseline severity, age may be a relevant factor in antidepressant selection. For patients over age 65, SSRIs may be less effective and SNRIs, such as duloxetine, may be more effective (Level 3) . For young patients up to age 25, the balance of efficacy, adverse reactions and risk of discontinuation symptoms may favour using fluoxetine or agomelatine over other antidepressants (Level 4) .

Access, cost, and ease of use are also important aspects, particularly for users with disabilities or language/literacy issues. While up-front costs for many DHIs may be low, some have additional costs such as subscriptions for extra features or therapist guidance. Disengagement is commonly experienced during a depressive episode, hence, normalizing and expecting this can reduce shame and allow conversations with patients about compensatory strategies. Clinicians can also ask patients about the current use of other apps to identify features which may support DHI (Digital health intervention) use (e.g., gamification, notifications, and social networking integration). Sharing data with a health care provider or a trusted support may also help the user make sense of changes in mood states over time, as well as detect any adverse events.

Question 4. What is the Role of DHIs? > Q.4.e. What are Examples of Unguided (Self-Directed) DHIs? > paragraph id: 148

More recently, some self-directed DHIs have introduced artificial intelligence (AI (Artificial intelligence)) to provide interactive feedback and simulate human conversation. These conversational agents, known as chatbots, can be programmed with either predefined responses, usually given by text but sometimes by voice, or free-range responses that are generated by AI (Artificial intelligence) algorithms. Chatbots potentially can provide personalized and tailored components of interventions, such as CBT (Cognitive-behavioural therapy), through interactive conversations while offering a sense of empathy, understanding, and nonjudgmental support. However, the clinical application of chatbots is still at an early stage and little is known about potential risks (such as inappropriate responses) from these AI (Artificial intelligence) systems. A recent meta-analysis summarized 4 trials in adults with depressive and anxiety symptoms; while chatbots had significant benefits compared to control conditions, only 1 trial included the diagnosis of MDD (Major depressive disorder) and the results were graded as low quality because of the small sample size and high-risk of bias (Level 3) . Hence, there is currently insufficient evidence to recommend chatbots and conversational agents for the treatment of MDD (Major depressive disorder).

Many individuals with depression are interested in using DHIs to support their mental health care but they often face challenges when looking for evidence-informed, engaging, and safe DHIs. Commercially available DHIs for depression are often promoted by internet or app store search algorithms, which prioritize popularity and often fail to disclose criteria for efficacy, safety, privacy, and security of personal health information. Positive user reviews may contain anecdotal evidence of utility, but they do not necessarily correlate with expert evaluation. While DHIs developed by academic researchers may be free of commercial bias and have a more robust evidence base, they are seldom publicly available.

Early improvement, often defined as a 20% or greater reduction in scores on a symptom rating scale within the first 4 weeks after starting an antidepressant, predicts a later response. Notably, if early improvement is not seen by 4 weeks, there is only a low likelihood of response or remission at 8 to 12 weeks. At that point, the decision should be to either increase the dose or to switch the antidepressant if there are tolerability concerns.

Question 7. What Should be Done When a Patient is not Better? > Q.7.c. How are Strategies Sequenced When There is a Poor Response to an Initial Antidepressant Treatment? > paragraph id: 187

Optimizing the antidepressant dose is an important first step. Higher than minimal therapeutic doses are more effective (to a plateau around the equivalent of 50 mg of fluoxetine) but less well-tolerated (Level 1) . Hence, increasing the dose for nonresponse must be balanced against increasing side effect burden and poorer adherence.

After optimizing the dose, the main medication options involve switching to another antidepressant or adding an adjunctive medication. The evidence for the efficacy of switching antidepressants is inconsistent. Meta-analyses show that switching to another antidepressant is not superior to continuing the same one (Level 2) and there appears to be diminishing response rates for antidepressant monotherapy beyond the first switch.

## Query 31
When a patient is better, how long should they continue their antidepressant for?

### Answer
We recommend that antidepressents be maintained for 6 to 12 months after a patient achieves remission unless a patient has risk factors for the recurrence of depressive factors, in which case treatment should be continued for 2 years or more. These risk factors include residual symptoms, chronic depressive episodes, medical comorbidities, greater number of previous episodes, poor social support, or persistent stressful life events.

The table presents a summary of recommendations for the treatment of depression, categorized into four levels of evidence. The first line of treatment is divided into two columns: "Line of treatment" and "Level of evidence." The "Line of treatment" column lists the recommendations, while the "Level of evidence" column indicates the level of evidence supporting each recommendation.

The first line of treatment includes the following recommendations:

*   For patients who have achieved symptom remission, using maintenance pharmacotherapy and/or psychotherapy can prevent recurrence.
	*   **Level of evidence**: Level 1

*   All patients treated with antidepressants should continue medication treatment for a minimum of 6 to 12 months after achieving symptomatic remission.
	*   **Level of evidence**: Level 1

*   Patients with risk factors for recurrence (see Table 6.2) should continue antidepressant treatment for 2 years or more.
	*   **Level of evidence**: Level 3

*   Patients with recurrent and severe MDEs should use sequential treatment (adding psychotherapy after stabilizing on medications) to prevent recurrence.
	*   **Level of evidence**: Level 1

*   When a decision is made to stop the antidepressant, it should be tapered gradually, whenever possible, for several weeks or months with more time between dose reductions near the end of the taper.
	*   **Level of evidence**: Level 3

*   For patients treated with medication for less than 4 weeks, the antidepressant can be tapered and discontinued quickly, over 2 weeks or less.
	*   **Level of evidence**: Level 3

*   Psychological treatments can be added before or during antidepressant discontinuation to help patients stop the antidepressant.
	*   **Level of evidence**: Level 2

Note. MDE (Major depressive episode) = major disorder episode

Question 7. What Should be Done When a Patient is not Better? > Q.7.c. How are Strategies Sequenced When There is a Poor Response to an Initial Antidepressant Treatment? > paragraph id: 187

Optimizing the antidepressant dose is an important first step. Higher than minimal therapeutic doses are more effective (to a plateau around the equivalent of 50 mg of fluoxetine) but less well-tolerated (Level 1) . Hence, increasing the dose for nonresponse must be balanced against increasing side effect burden and poorer adherence.

Question 7. What Should be Done When a Patient is not Better? > Q.7.a. What Contributes to a Poor Response to Treatment? > paragraph id: 249

[Table: Table 7.1. Factors Contributing to Poor Response to Initial Treatment.]
Caption: Factors Contributing to Poor Response to Initial Treatment.
Row 0 - Clinical factors: Incorrect diagnosis (e.g., bipolar disorder)
Demographic and illness characteristics (e.g., older age, female sex, younger age of onset, higher severity, increased number/duration of episodes, and trauma history)
Psychiatric medical comorbidities (e.g., anxiety disorders, personality disorders, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, substance use disorders, etc.)
Nonpsychiatric medical comorbidities (e.g., anaemia, obesity, sleep apnea, thyroid disease, etc.)
Acute or chronic stressors, Treatment factors: Inadequate dose of treatment
Inadequate duration of treatment
Side effects masking as symptoms
Poor adherence to treatment
Pharmacogenetic variability (e.g., rapid or slow metabolism of drugs)

Question 7. What Should be Done When a Patient is not Better? > Q.7.a. What Contributes to a Poor Response to Treatment? > paragraph id: 181

Several clinical, comorbidity, and medication factors may contribute to insufficient treatment response ( Table 7.1 ). Comorbid psychiatric conditions associated with poor treatment response include anxiety disorders, ADHD (Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder), post-traumatic stress disorder, substance use disorders, and personality disorders. Comorbid nonpsychiatric medical conditions may also be associated with poor response to antidepressants. For example, undiagnosed sleep apnea may be an important contributor to persistent residual symptoms of insomnia, fatigue, and low motivation. Clinicians should also be aware that comorbid conditions do not remain static over time. Hence, regular reassessment is important for patients with persistent symptoms.

## Query 33
I am considering referring my patient to ECT for their depression. Would I need to stop their medications?

### Answer
Antidepressants and other medications can usually be continued during ECT treatment. A meta-analysis found that concurrent use of antidepressants during a course of ECT improved outcomes, but this was low-quality evidence based on older trials. Some concomitant medications may interfere with ECT efficacy (e.g., benzodiazepines and anticonvulsant medications) or worsen cognitive side effects (lithium and cannabis), and should be discontinued or held before ECT.

Question 8. When Should Neuromodulation Treatments be Used? > Q.8.b. What Noninvasive Neuromodulation Treatments are Available? > Electroconvulsive Therapy > paragraph id: 215

ECT (Electroconvulsive therapy) has demonstrated evidence of efficacy and tolerability in the treatment of depressive episodes, with response rates ranging from 65% to 75% (Level 1) . ECT (Electroconvulsive therapy) may be especially effective in older patients, those with psychotic or catatonic features, and more severely depressed patients. Importantly, results of retrospective cohort analyses conclude that the benefits of ECT (Electroconvulsive therapy) outweigh the risks among hospitalized MDD (Major depressive disorder) patients, with no evidence of increased risk of serious medical events. Furthermore, ECT (Electroconvulsive therapy) significantly reduced the risk of suicide in the year after discharge from hospital.

Question 8. When Should Neuromodulation Treatments be Used? > Q.8.b. What Noninvasive Neuromodulation Treatments are Available? > Electroconvulsive Therapy > paragraph id: 218

Antidepressants and other medications can usually be continued during ECT (Electroconvulsive therapy) treatment (Level 2) . A meta-analysis found that concurrent use of antidepressants during a course of ECT (Electroconvulsive therapy) improved outcomes, but this was low-quality evidence based on older trials. Ketamine has not been shown to improve outcomes with ECT (Electroconvulsive therapy), whether as an anaesthetic agent or with single-dose IV infusions given during a course of ECT (Electroconvulsive therapy). Some concomitant medications may interfere with ECT (Electroconvulsive therapy) efficacy (e.g., benzodiazepines and anticonvulsant medications) or worsen cognitive side effects (lithium and cannabis), and should be discontinued or held before ECT (Electroconvulsive therapy).

Question 8. When Should Neuromodulation Treatments be Used? > Q.8.b. What Noninvasive Neuromodulation Treatments are Available? > Electroconvulsive Therapy > paragraph id: 214

ECT (Electroconvulsive therapy) involves the delivery of an electrical stimulus via electrodes placed on the scalp, resulting in the induction of a brief generalized seizure. ECT (Electroconvulsive therapy) is delivered under general anaesthesia and after a muscle relaxant has been administered to minimize the physical manifestations of the seizure and its potential complications. ECT (Electroconvulsive therapy) remains one of the most effective treatment options for patients with TRD (Treatment-resistant depression). However, the clinical use of ECT (Electroconvulsive therapy) is often hindered by stigma, the need for general anaesthesia, concern about cognitive adverse effects, and high rates of relapse after acute treatment.
