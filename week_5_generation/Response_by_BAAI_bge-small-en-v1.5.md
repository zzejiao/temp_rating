## Query 6
My patient with a major depressive episode of mild severity is interested in complementary and alternative medicine options. What would be the most appropriate option to present?

### Answer
St. John's Wort

## Response
### Recommended Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) Options for Mild Major Depressive Episode (MDE)

* **First Line of Treatment:**
	+ **St. John's wort** for MDE of mild severity.
		- **Level of evidence:** Level 1
* **Reasoning:** 
	+ The clinical guidelines context recommends **St. John's wort** as the first-line treatment for mild MDE due to its high level of evidence (Level 1), indicating a high-quality meta-analysis with narrow confidence intervals and/or 2 or more RCTs with adequate sample size.

- **Reference:** [https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#table16-07067437241245384](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#table16-07067437241245384)

### Important Considerations

* The Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) recommends considering CAM treatments alone only for MDE of mild severity.
* CAM treatments may be used as adjuncts to standard treatments in moderate severity illness.
* The level of evidence for CAM treatments is generally lower than that for first-line psychotherapy or pharmacotherapy treatments for moderate to severe depression.

- **Reference:** [https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#section5M-07067437241245384](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#section5M-07067437241245384)

## Query 7
My patient is presenting with a mild severity major depressive episode. All other things being equal and accessible, what does CANMAT recommend for treatment?

### Answer
Psychotherapy because of fewer side effects, although psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy are equally effective

## Response
* **Treatment Recommendations for Mild Severity Major Depressive Episode:**
    + Unfortunately, the provided Clinical Guidelines Context does not explicitly state the recommended treatment for a mild severity major depressive episode according to CANMAT.
    + The context emphasizes the importance of a collaborative, personalized, and systematic management approach but does not specify particular treatments for mild cases.
* **Considerations:**
    + The guidelines suggest that treatment decisions should be made within the context of each patient, considering individual variability and the limitations of the evidence base.
    + Regulatory requirements for medications and availability can vary by country.
* **Reference:** 
    - [CANMAT Guidelines](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#sec4) provide a framework for managing Major Depressive Disorder but do not offer specific medication recommendations for mild severity cases in the given context.
* **Conclusion:** 
    - No clear recommendation found in the clinical guideline for the treatment of mild severity major depressive episodes. It is recommended to consult the full CANMAT guidelines or other clinical resources for more detailed information on treatment options, including **medications** such as **Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs)**, which are commonly used in the treatment of major depressive disorder but are not specified in the provided context.

## Query 8
My patient's depression has not responded to the medication dose I started them on a four weeks ago.  What should I do next?

### Answer
Optimize the dose

## Response
### Next Steps for Patient with Depression Not Responding to Medication

Given that your patient's depression has not responded to the initial medication dose after four weeks, the following steps are recommended based on the clinical guidelines provided:

* **Optimize Dose**: If the current dose is not at the therapeutic level, consider increasing it, balancing efficacy with potential side effects and adherence issues.
* **Consider Adding Psychological Treatments**: Psychotherapy can be considered earlier in treatment, especially if there's a partial response or intolerance to medication.
* **Switch or Adjunctive Medication**: 
    + **Switch to Another Antidepressant**: Especially if there are intolerance issues. Consider an antidepressant with a distinct mechanism of action or one with evidence of superior efficacy.
    + **Add an Adjunctive Medication**: If there's a partial response to the initial antidepressant and it's well-tolerated. First-line options include **Aripiprazole**, **Brexpiprazole**, **Bupropion**, and others.

### Preferred Options and Rationale

1. **Optimize Dose**: This is often the first step due to its simplicity and the potential for improved efficacy without adding additional medications.
2. **Switch to Another Antidepressant**: If the patient has not responded to the initial medication, switching to a different antidepressant, especially one with a different mechanism of action, can offer a better response. **Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs)**, **Serotonin-Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors (SNRIs)**, and other classes can be considered based on the patient's specific situation and previous treatment response.

### Important Considerations

- **Patient-Specific Factors**: Consider psychiatric and nonpsychiatric comorbidities, adherence to treatment, and other biological and psychological factors that may interfere with response.
- **Pharmacogenetic Testing**: May be considered to assess how genetic factors might influence the patient's response to certain medications.

## Query 9
My patient's depression has not responded to the SSRI medication I started them on, even after I optimized and increased the dose up to where they could still tolerate the side effects. I haven't tried anything else yet. What should I do now?

### Answer
If available, consider referral to psychotherapy for CBT, IPT, or behavioural activation

## Response
### Recommendations for Next Steps in Treatment

Given that the patient's depression has not responded to the **SSRI** medication, the following options are recommended:

* **Switch to Another Antidepressant**: Consider an antidepressant with a mechanism of action that is distinct from the previous one, such as **bupropion** or **mittazapine**. This is especially relevant if there are intolerance issues with the initial antidepressant.
* **Add an Adjunctive Medication**: If there is a partial response to the initial antidepressant and it is well tolerated, consider adding **aripiprazole** or **brexpiprazole**. Other options include **bupropion**, **N-e-sketamine/lv**, **ketamine**, **cariprazine**, **lithium**, **modafinil**, **olanzapine**, **quetiapine-XL**, **risperidone**, or **triiodothyronine**.

### Rationale

The patient has already undergone optimization and dose increase of the **SSRI** medication, and it is now necessary to consider alternative strategies. Switching to another antidepressant or adding an adjunctive medication are both viable options, with the choice depending on the patient's specific circumstances and tolerance to side effects.

## Query 10
My patient's depression has not responded to the SSRI medication I started them on, even after I optimized and increased the dose up to where they could still tolerate the side effects. They are not interested in psychotherapy. What should I do now?

### Answer
Since there is tolerability issues and no response, consider switching to an antidepressant of a different class such as an SNRI

## Response
### Recommendations for Next Steps in Treatment

Given that the patient's depression has not responded to the **SSRI** medication and they are not interested in psychotherapy, the following options can be considered:

* **Switch to Another Antidepressant**: Especially if there are intolerance issues with the initial antidepressant. Consider an antidepressant with a mechanism of action that is distinct from the previous one, such as:
	+ **Bupropion**
	+ **Mirtazapine**
	+ Other antidepressants with evidence of superior efficacy
* **Add an Adjunctive Medication**: Especially if there is a partial response to the initial antidepressant and it is well tolerated. Consider:
	+ **Aripiprazole**
	+ **Brexpiprazole**
	+ Other adjunctive medications such as **lithium**, **quetiapine-XL**, or **risperidone**

### Rationale

The patient has already optimized the dose of their initial **SSRI** medication, and increasing the dose further may not be effective and may increase side effects. Switching to another antidepressant or adding an adjunctive medication are the next steps in the treatment algorithm.

My patient's depression achieved a partial response to the SSRI medication I started them on, but the improvements have been less than hoped. They are not experiencing any side effects from the SSRI. What should I do?

### Answer
Start them on adjunctive aripiprazole or brexpiprazole

## Response
### Recommendations for Patient with Partial Response to SSRI

Given that your patient has achieved a partial response to the **SSRI** medication and is not experiencing any side effects, the following options can be considered:

* **Optimize Dose**: If the current dose is not at the maximum therapeutic level, consider increasing the dose of the **SSRI**.
* **Add an Adjunctive Medication**: Since the patient has a partial response to the **SSRI** and is tolerating it well, adding an adjunctive medication could be beneficial. 
    - **First Line** options for adjunctive medications include:
        - **Aripiprazole**
        - **Brexpiprazole**
        - **Bupropion**
        - **N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists like ketamine or esketamine**
    - These medications can be added to the existing **SSRI** regimen to potentially enhance the therapeutic response.

### Reference
- **Reference:** [Clinical Guidelines for Treating Depression](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#section9C-07067437241245384)
- The decision to switch or add medications should be based on a comprehensive review of the patient's previous medication trials, side effects experienced, and the presence of a partial response. 

It's essential to carefully evaluate the patient's specific situation and consider factors such as psychiatric and nonpsychiatric comorbidities, adherence to treatment, and other biological and psychological factors that may interfere with the treatment response.

## Query 12
My patient's severe major depressive episode did not respond to an SSRI, and did not respond to SNRI after switching to it. I tried adding adjunctive pharmacotherapy as well but it did not work. What should I do now?

### Answer
ECT

## Response
### Next Steps for Treatment-Resistant Depression

Given that your patient's severe major depressive episode did not respond to an **SSRI** (Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor) and then to an **SNRI** (Serotonin-Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitor) after switching, and also did not respond to adjunctive pharmacotherapy, the following steps can be considered based on the provided clinical guidelines:

* **Assess Factors Interfering with Treatment Response**: Before proceeding, it's crucial to assess factors that could interfere with treatment response, including psychiatric and nonpsychiatric comorbidities, adherence to treatment, other biological and psychological factors, and pharmacokinetic factors. Consider pharmacogenetic testing if necessary.
* **Optimize Dose**: If not already done, optimize the dose of the current medication if there's a possibility of achieving a therapeutic dose without significant side effects.
* **Consider Psychological Treatments**: Psychotherapy should be considered earlier rather than later in the treatment process. It can be used alongside medication or as an alternative if medications have failed.
* **Switch or Adjunctive Medication**:
    + **Switch to Another Antidepressant**: Especially if there are intolerance issues with the current antidepressant. Consider an antidepressant with a distinct mechanism of action from previous ones or one with evidence of superior efficacy.
    + **Add an Adjunctive Medication**: If there's a partial response to the initial antidepressant and it's well-tolerated. First-line options include **Aripiprazole**, **Brexpiprazole**, **Bupropion**, **N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists like Ketamine**, among others.
* **Consider Neuromodulation Treatments for TRD (Treatment-Resistant Depression)**: These are generally considered after other strategies have failed. First-line options include **Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT)** for severe major depressive episodes and **Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS)** for treatment-resistant depression.

### Preferred Options

Given the patient's history of non-response to **SSRI** and **SNRI**, and adjunctive pharmacotherapy, switching to an antidepressant with a different mechanism of action or adding an adjunctive medication with a different action mechanism could be considered. Among the adjunctive medications, **Aripiprazole** and **Bupropion** are mentioned as first-line options due to

## Query 16
My patient has had recurrent depressive episodes, and has now once again had their symptoms relieved by the medications I've prescribed. They want longer-lasting benefits and want help with preventing recurrent episodes in the future. What should can I offer them?

### Answer
Suggest adding psychotherapy such as CBT to be sequentially added once the acute phase of depression is over.

## Response
To prevent recurrent depressive episodes in your patient, you can offer the following options:
* **Maintenance pharmacotherapy**: Continue the patient's current **antidepressant** medication for at least 6 to 12 months after achieving symptom remission. This can reduce relapse rates by 50% compared to placebo.
* **Psychotherapy**: Add psychotherapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), to the patient's treatment plan. This can be done in conjunction with maintenance pharmacotherapy to prevent recurrence.

It's essential to assess the patient's risk factors for recurrence, such as residual symptoms, history of maltreatment or abuse during childhood, and prior depressive episodes. If the patient has risk factors, consider continuing **antidepressant** treatment for 2 years or more.

When deciding to stop the **antidepressant**, it's recommended to taper the medication gradually over several weeks or months.

## Query 17
I am about to start my patient on citalopram. Is there any monitoring or investigations I should order for them based on the guidelines?

### Answer
ECG to check for QTc

## Response
### Monitoring and Investigations for **Citalopram** 

When starting a patient on **citalopram**, several monitoring and investigation considerations should be taken into account based on the clinical guidelines provided:

* **QTc Prolongation**: **Citalopram** carries a risk of QTc prolongation. Although the clinical risk is considered low, and **citalopram** has been used safely in large trials of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) with comorbid cardiovascular disease, monitoring for QTc prolongation is advisable, especially in patients with cardiovascular disease or those taking other medications that may prolong the QTc interval.
* **Liver Function Tests (LFTs)**: Like most antidepressants, **citalopram** has a risk of elevation of liver function tests (LFTs). Regular monitoring of LFTs may be necessary, especially if there are pre-existing liver conditions or if the patient is taking other medications that can affect liver function.
* **Side Effects Monitoring**: The patient should be monitored for common side effects associated with **citalopram**, such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dry mouth, somnolence, nervousness, anxiety, agitation, fatigue, sweating, tremor, and anorexia, as outlined in Table 3.4 of the clinical guidelines.
* **Psychiatric and Nonpsychiatric Comorbidities**: Assessing factors that can interfere with treatment response, including psychiatric and nonpsychiatric comorbidities, adherence to treatment, and other biological and psychological factors, is crucial when initiating **citalopram**.
* **Pharmacogenetic Testing**: Considering pharmacogenetic factors may be beneficial, especially if there are concerns about the patient's response to **citalopram** or potential drug interactions.

## Query 20
My patient with a moderate severity major depressive episode has tried an SSRI, without good effect, and now wants to try an SNRI. Their top priority is efficacy, and they are not concerned about any specific side effects. What's the best option for them?

### Answer
Venlafaxine-XR

## Response
* **Medication Recommendation:** For a patient with a moderate severity major depressive episode who has tried an SSRI without good effect and now wants to try an SNRI, with efficacy as the top priority, **Duloxetine** is a preferred option. 
* **Reasoning:** The 2016 CANMAT guidelines suggest that SNRIs, such as **Duloxetine**, may have superior efficacy for cognitive dysfunction and comorbid pain conditions compared to SSRIs (Level 2 evidence) [**Reference:**](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#section5G-07067437241245384). Additionally, **Duloxetine** is a recommended first-line treatment for somatic symptoms, particularly pain (Level 1 evidence), and a second-line treatment for cognitive dysfunction and fatigue (Level 2 evidence) [**Reference:**](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#table15-07067437241245384).
* **Alternative Option:** Another SNRI, such as **Venlafaxine**, could also be considered, although it is not explicitly mentioned in the provided clinical guidelines context as a first-line option for the specified conditions.
* **Important Consideration:** When switching to another antidepressant, it's crucial to assess factors that can interfere with treatment response, such as psychiatric and nonpsychiatric comorbidities, adherence to treatment, and pharmacokinetic factors (consider pharmacogenetic testing) [**Reference:**](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#fig2-07067437241245384).

## Query 25
Whar do the levels of evidence correspond to?

### Answer
Level 1 evidence corresponds to high-quality meta-analysis with narrow confidencei intervals and/or 2 or more RCTs. Level 2 evidence is lower-quality meta-analysis, which Level 3 is a small-sample RCT or nonrandomized controlled prospective study, or high quality retrospective study. Level 4 are expert opinions/consensus

## Response
* The levels of evidence correspond to the following criteria:
  + **Level 1**: High-quality meta-analysis with narrow confidence intervals and/or 2 or more RCTs with adequate sample size, preferably placebo-controlled.
  + **Level 2**: Lower-quality meta-analysis with wide confidence intervals and/or 1 or more RCTs with adequate sample size.
  + **Level 3**: Small-sample RCTs or nonrandomized, controlled prospective studies or high-quality retrospective studies.
  + **Level 4**: Expert opinion/consensus.
* These levels of evidence are used to evaluate the strength of evidence for statements and recommendations in the guidelines.
* **Reference:** [Table A](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#table1-07067437241245384) provides the criteria for each level of evidence.

## Query 26
What are r isk factors for depression?

### Answer
There are numerous risk factors for major depressive disorder. These include family history, history of adverse childhood expereinces, comorbid medical ilnesses, comorbid substance use. There are also social and enviromental risk factors, such as stressful life events, job strain, income inequlity, bulling, sedentary life style, and working night shifts.

## Response
* **Risk Factors for Depression:**
  + Static nonmodifiable risk factors (e.g., older age, female sex, younger age of onset, higher severity, increased number/duration of episodes, and trauma history) 
  + Dynamic, potentially modifiable risk factors (e.g., stressful life events and circumstances, bereavement, sedentary lifestyle, increased screen time, and shift work)
  + Comorbid psychiatric conditions (e.g., anxiety disorders, ADHD, post-traumatic stress disorder, substance use disorders, and personality disorders)
  + Comorbid nonpsychiatric medical conditions (e.g., undiagnosed sleep apnea, anaemia, obesity, thyroid disease)
* **Important Considerations:**
  + Regular reassessment is crucial for patients with persistent symptoms, as comorbid conditions can change over time.
  + Screening for depression using a validated scale (e.g., PHQ-2 followed by PHQ-9) is recommended in individuals with risk factors for depression.
* **Reference:** [Clinical Guidelines](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#section3A2-07067437241245384) and [Table 7.1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#table5-07067437241245384) provide more information on risk factors and assessment recommendations for major depressive disorder (MDD).

## Query 27
Should a patient on an antidepressant also see a therapist?

### Answer
Yes, when possible, combining psychological treatments with pharmacotherapy is more effective than either alone for acute treatment, and reduces the risk of recurrence.

## Response
* The clinical guidelines context does not explicitly state that a patient on an **antidepressant** should also see a therapist. However, it does suggest considering psychological treatments, such as psychotherapy, earlier rather than later in treatment, especially when there is a suboptimal response to initial **antidepressant** medication.
* According to the algorithm for sequential treatment after suboptimal response to initial **antidepressant** medication (Figure 7.1), **Consider Adding Psychological Treatments** is one of the steps after optimizing the dose.
* The guidelines also mention that psychological treatments (see Table 3.2) should be considered when patients have suboptimal responses to an initial medication.
* **Reference:** [Reference 1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#fig2-07067437241245384) 
* It can be inferred that while medication is a primary treatment option, psychological treatments, including therapy, can be a valuable adjunct to **antidepressant** medication, especially in cases where there is a poor response to initial treatment.

## Query 28
I have a patient who often struggles with constipation Would paroxetine be  a good antidepressant to try first?

### Answer
While paroxetine is a first-line antidepressant, its risk of constipation is somewhat high, around 14%.  First line agents with less change of constipation include  escitalopram, sertraline, desvenlafaxine, vortioxetine, vilazodone and bupropion.

## Response
* **Medication Recommendation:** 
    + Considering the patient's constipation issue, **paroxetine** might not be the best initial choice due to its potential side effects, including gastrointestinal issues. 
    + A more suitable option could be **bupropion**, as it has a more favorable side effect profile and is recommended as a second-line treatment for difficult-to-treat depression.
* **Reasoning:** 
    + The clinical guidelines context does not explicitly address constipation as a factor in selecting an antidepressant. However, it does discuss the efficacy and side effect profiles of various medications.
    + **Paroxetine** is mentioned as one of the medications with evidence for superior response, but it also has clinically relevant potential interactions with other medications.
    + **Bupropion**, on the other hand, is recommended as a second-line treatment and has a more favorable side effect profile, making it a potentially better option for patients with constipation issues.
* **Reference:** 
    + [Reference 1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#section5E-07067437241245384)

## Query 29
My patient wants to use an AI app for thier depression, is this safe?

### Answer
This application is currently using the 2023 update of the CANMAT guidelines, published in 2024. At the time of its publication, digital health applications for direct-use by pateints had limited evidence. Applications should be assede for whether their techniques are evidence-based and evaluated on real-world populations. Other important factors include the privacy and security of the tool, the potential for providing harmful or inaccurate advice, and whether the patient may experience any barriers

## Response
* The safety of using an AI app for depression is a concern, as commercially available apps often prioritize popularity over efficacy, safety, privacy, and security of personal health information.
* While some AI apps, such as chatbots, may provide interactive feedback and simulate human conversation, the clinical application of these apps is still at an early stage, and little is known about potential risks, such as inappropriate responses.
* A recent meta-analysis found that chatbots had significant benefits compared to control conditions, but the results were graded as low quality due to the small sample size and high risk of bias.
* **No clear recommendation** can be made for the use of AI apps for depression, as the current evidence is insufficient.
* Clinicians should exercise caution when recommending AI apps for depression and consider factors such as access, cost, and ease of use, particularly for users with disabilities or language/literacy issues.
* **No medication** is recommended in this context, as the discussion is focused on the use of AI apps for depression.
* **Reference:** [https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#section6E-07067437241245384](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#section6E-07067437241245384)

## Query 30
How do I know if an antidepressant is working?

### Answer
The guidelines recommend the use of measurement-based care, which involves the routine use of validated outcome scales which are reviewed the pateints, and are used alongside clinical assesement to support collaborative decision-making. Examples of validated scales include patient-rated scales like the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), and clinican-rated scalces such as the Hamilton DEpression Rating Scale (HAM-D).

## Response
* To determine if an **antidepressant** is working, it's essential to monitor treatment using validated rating scales, as recommended in Table 5.1, with a **Level of evidence**: Level 2.
* The clinical guidelines context does not provide explicit information on how to know if an **antidepressant** is working. However, it can be reasonably inferred that monitoring treatment using validated rating scales and laboratory tests, when clinically indicated, can help determine the effectiveness of the **antidepressant**.
* According to Table 5.1, it is recommended to obtain laboratory and imaging tests only when clinically indicated, with a **Level of evidence**: Level 4.
* Additionally, monitoring weight, glucose, and lipid profiles at baseline and every 6 months when prescribing medications associated with weight gain is recommended, with a **Level of evidence**: Level 2.
* **Reference:** [Reference 1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#table20-07067437241245384) 
* **Reference:** [Reference 2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#section7D-07067437241245384) 
* Some common **antidepressants** and their side effects are listed in Table 3.4, including:
  + **SSRIs (Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors)**: **Citalopram**, **Escitalopram**, **Fluoxetine**, **Fluvoxamine**, **Paroxetine**, and **Sertraline**.
  + **SNRIs (Serotonin-Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors)**: **Desvenlafaxine**, **Duloxetine**, **Levomilnacipran**, **Milnacipran**, and **Venlafaxine-XR**.
  + **Others**: **Agomelatine**, **Bupropion**, **Mirtazapine**, **Vilazodone**, and **Vortioxetine**.

## Query 31
When a patient is better, how long should they continue their antidepressant for?

### Answer
We recommend that antidepressents be maintained for 6 to 12 months after a patient achieves remission unless a patient has risk factors for the recurrence of depressive factors, in which case treatment should be continued for 2 years or more. These risk factors include residual symptoms, chronic depressive episodes, medical comorbidities, greater number of previous episodes, poor social support, or persistent stressful life events.

## Response
* The general recommendation for patients who have achieved symptomatic remission is to continue **antidepressant** treatment for a minimum of 6 to 12 months after remission.
* For patients with risk factors for recurrence, **antidepressant** treatment should be continued for 2 years or more.
* The decision to stop **antidepressant** treatment should be based on individual patient factors, including risk of recurrence and history of depressive episodes.
* When stopping **antidepressant** treatment, it is recommended to taper the medication gradually over several weeks or months.

## Query 32
My patient has not responded to escitalopram at 10 mg, what should I do next?

### Answer
Assuming the dose is well tolerated, a first step could be to optimize the escitalopram dose to 20 mg.

## Response
### Next Steps for Patient Not Responding to **Escitalopram** at 10 mg

* **Assess factors that can interfere with treatment response**: 
    + Psychiatric and nonpsychiatric comorbidities
    + Adherence to treatment
    + Other biological and psychological factors which may interfere with response
    + Pharmacokinetic factors (consider pharmacogenetic testing)
* **Optimize Dose**: If another therapeutic dose, or partial response to well-tolerated lower doses within the therapeutic range. 
* **Consider Adding Psychological Treatments**: Consider psychotherapy earlier rather than later in treatment
* **Switch or Adjunctive Medication**:
    + **Switch to Another Antidepressant**: Especially if there are intolerance issues with the initial antidepressant. Consider an antidepressant with a mechanism of action that is distinct from previous one.
    + **Add an Adjunctive Medication**: Especially if there is a partial response to initial antidepressant and it is well tolerated.

## Query 33
I am considering referring my patient to ECT for their depression. Would I need to stop their medications?

### Answer
Antidepressants and other medications can usually be continued during ECT treatment. A meta-analysis found that concurrent use of antidepressants during a course of ECT improved outcomes, but this was low-quality evidence based on older trials. Some concomitant medications may interfere with ECT efficacy (e.g., benzodiazepines and anticonvulsant medications) or worsen cognitive side effects (lithium and cannabis), and should be discontinued or held before ECT.

## Response
* **Medication Considerations for ECT:** 
  + Generally, **antidepressants** and other medications can be continued during ECT treatment (Level 2).
  + However, some medications may interfere with ECT efficacy or worsen cognitive side effects, such as:
    - **Benzodiazepines**
    - **Anticonvulsant medications**
    - **Lithium** (may worsen cognitive side effects)
    - **Cannabis** (may worsen cognitive side effects)
  + These medications should be discontinued or held before ECT.
* **Reference:** [Electroconvulsive Therapy](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11351064/#section10B1-07067437241245384) 
* It is essential to weigh the benefits and risks of continuing or discontinuing medications during ECT treatment, considering individual patient factors and the potential impact on treatment outcomes.
